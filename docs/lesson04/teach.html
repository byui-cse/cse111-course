    <h1>04 Team Activity: Retrieve Star Wars Data from a Web Server</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Arrange a one-hour synchronous meeting with your team for this
    activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing meeting.
    Campus students will use class time for this meeting. You should
    prepare for this meeting by completing the preparation material and
    the individual checkpoint assignment beforehand.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Star Wars is a series of movies about fictional characters and
    events that lived and happened a long time ago in a galaxy far far
    away. Because the movies are popular, there are many fan websites
    that contain information about the movies. One such website is
    <a target="_blank" href="swapi.co">swapi.co</a> swapi.co maintains a
    web service that contains lots of data gleaned from the movies and
    books about the fictional characters and places that are part of the
    Star Wars galaxy. During this activity, your team will write a
    Python program that uses the <code>requests</code> module to
    retrieve data from the swapi service.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <p>The Python <code>requests</code> module contains functions to
    send http requests for data to a computer server on the internet and
    to read the data that the server returns. Read about the requests
    module at <a target="_blank"
    href="https://requests.readthedocs.io#requests-http-for-humans">requests.readthedocs.io</a></p>

    <p>The Star Wars API (swapi) maintains lots of data about the
    ficitional Star Wars galaxy. Read about swapi and experiment with it
    at <a target="_blank"
    href="https://swapi.co/documentation">swapi.co/documentation</a></p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Open the <a target="_blank"
    href="https://swapi.co/documentation">Star Wars API documenation</a>
    in your browser. From the documentation you can read that this URL
    <a target="_blank"
    href="https://swapi.co/api/planets">https://swapi.co/api/planets</a>
    will return data about all the planets in the Star Wars galaxy, and
    this URL <a target="_blank"
    href="https://swapi.co/api/planets">https://swapi.co/api/planets/{i}</a>
    where <var>{i}</var> is an integer will return data about an
    individual planet.</p>

    <p>Use the commodities.py program, that you downloaded during this
    lesson's checkpoint, as a reference, and write a Python program to
    retrieve the population for each planet and calculate and display
    the total population of all planets in the Star Wars galaxy.</p>

    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Your program must use the <code>requests</code> module
        to retrieve data from this URL: <a target=_"blank"
        href="https://swapi.co/api/planets">https://swapi.co/api/planets</a>
        and then get the count of planets from that data.</div></li>

        <li><div>Your program must contain a loop that repeats once for
        each planet. Within that loop your program must use the
        <code>requests</code> module to retrieve the data for each
        planet and then get the population from that data and add that
        population into a total population.</div></li>

        <li><div>Your program must print the total population.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an hour,
    complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that the
    stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Add something or change something in your program that
        you think would make your program better, easier for the user,
        more elegant, or more fun. Be creative.</div></li>

        <li><div>Write comments above the lines of code that were
        difficult for you to understand.</div></li>

        <li><div>Change your program to count the number of planets that
        are known to have surface water.</div></li>

        <li><div>Change your program to compute the average height for
        all the characters in the swapi database.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Run</h2>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="testing">
        <li><div></div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one-hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
    sample solution. Please <strong>do not look at the sample
    solution</strong> until you have either finished the program or
    diligently worked for at least one hour. At the end of the hour, if
    you are still struggling to complete the assignment, you may use the
    sample solution to help you finish.</p>

        <li>Sample solution:
        <a href="./teach_solution.py">teach_solution.py</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Warning</h2>
    <p>Now that you know how to use the <code>requests</code> module to
    retrieve data, you have enough knowledge to launch a denial of
    service (DOS) attack against a web server. If you write a program
    that quickly makes thousands or millions of requests to a server,
    your program's requests will overwhelm the server. Then other
    programs that are making normal, legitimate requests will not be
    served because the server is too busy with the flood of requests
    from your program. This is a denial of service attack. Don't do
    this. Launching a DOS attack is rude, unethical, likely illegal, a
    violation of the BYU-Idaho honor code, and not something that a
    disciple of Jesus Christ would knowingly do. Launching a DOS attack,
    either purposefully or accidentally, will lead to your computer's IP
    address being locked on the server which means the server will
    refuse to serve your computer. With great power, comes great
    responsibility.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
