<article>
    <h1>04 Team Activity: Calling Functions</h1>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Arrange a one hour synchronous meeting with your team for this
    activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing meeting.
    Campus students will use class time for this meeting. You should
    prepare for this meeting by completing the preparation material and
    the individual checkpoint assignment beforehand.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>When working on a long task or completing a long term goal,
    people sometimes find it difficult to stay motivated. Some people
    find that inspiring quotes from others who accomplished similar
    tasks help them to stay motivated. During this activity, your team
    will write a Python program that prints a quote chosen randomly from
    a file of quotes.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <p>The built-in <a target="_blank"
    href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open"><code>open function</code></a>
    opens a file for reading or writing. The prepare content for the
    previous lesson contains <a target="_blank"
    href="../lesson03/prepare.html#textFiles">example code</a> that
    reads all the lines of text from a text file into a list.</p>

    <p>The Python <code>random</code> module contains functions to
    generate pseudo random numbers and to make pseudo random choices.
    Read about the <code>random</code> module in one of these
    articles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>Official Python <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html">reference for the <code>random</code> module</a></div></li>
        <li><div><a target="_blank" href="https://realpython.com/lessons/random-data-generation-python/">Lesson about <code>random</code></a> at Real Python</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Python <code>textwrap</code> module contains functions to
    format plain text. The module formats text by adding, removing, and
    moving line breaks in the input text. Read about the
    <code>textwrap</code> module in this article:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>Official Python reference for the
        <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/textwrap.html"><code>textwrap</code> module</a></div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Download this file: <a download href="quotes.txt">quotes.txt</a>
    and save it in the same folder where you will save your Python
    program.</p>

    <p>Write a Python program named <code>quotes.py</code> that reads
    the contents of the <code>quotes.txt</code> file into a list and
    then randomly chooses one of the quotes and prints it for the user
    to see. Include these two lines of code at the top of your program
    to import the functions in the <code>random</code> and
    <code>textwrap</code> modules:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">import random
import textwrap</pre></div>

    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Your program must call the <code>open</code> function
        to open the <code>quotes.txt</code> file and read all the lines
        in the file into a list.</div></li>

        <li><div>Your program must call <code>random.choice</code> to
        randomly choose one of the quotes from the list.</div></li>

        <li><div>Your program must call <code>textwrap.wrap</code> to
        wrap the words of the chosen quote to 70 characters or fewer per
        line and call <code>print</code> to print the wrapped lines of
        the quote for the user to see.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an hour,
    complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that the
    stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Add something or change something in your program that
        you think would make your program better, easier for the user,
        more elegant, or more fun. Be creative.</div></li>

        <li><div>Write comments above the lines of code that were
        difficult for you to understand.</div></li>

        <li><div>Allow the user to enter a positive integer to choose
        how many quotes are chosen and printed.</div></li>

        <li><div>Write a new program that reads the
        <code>quotes.txt</code> file and then prints all of the names of
        the authors, but just the names and not the quotes. Hint: notice
        that the author's name appears at the end of each quote,
        separated from the quote by a dash (-). However, notice also
        that some quotes contain a dash. To find the location of the
        last dash, use the <a target="_blank"
        href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.rindex">rindex</a>
        function.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Run</h2>
<pre class="console">&gt; python teach_solution.py
How many quotes would you like? <span class="input">2</span>

If you want to achieve excellence, you can get there today. As of this
second, quit doing less-than-excellent work. -Thomas J. Watson

B is for believe--in yourself, in those around you, and in eternal
principles. -Thomas S. Monson</pre>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="test long">
        <li><div>Run your program and verify that it outputs a quote (or
        multiple quotes if you completed stretch challenge #4).</div></li>
        <li><div>Run your program again and verify that it outputs a
        different quote.</div></li>
        <li><div>If the quotes that you program printed are short, run
        your program again until it prints a long quote that wraps onto
        two or more lines. Verify that each line contains no more than
        70 characters.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
    <a download href="teach_solution.py">sample solution</a>. Please
    <strong>do not look at the sample solution</strong> until you have
    either finished the program or diligently worked for at least one
    hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling to
    complete the assignment, you may use the sample solution to help you
    finish.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
