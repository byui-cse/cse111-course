		<h1>04 Team Activity: Retrieving Data from a Web Service</h1>

		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Arrange a one-hour synchronous meeting with your team for
		this activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing
		meeting. Campus students will use class time for this
		meeting.</p>

		<p>You should prepare for this meeting by completing the
		preparation material and the individual checkpoint assignment
		beforehand.</p>

		<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
		<p>Star Wars is a series of movies about fictional characters
		and events that lived and happened a long time ago in a galaxy
		far far away. Because the movies are popular, there are many
		fan websites that contain information about the movies. One such
		website is <a target="_blank" href="swapi.co">swapi.co</a>
		swapi.co maintains a web service that contains lots of data
		gleaned from the movies and books about the fictional characters
		and places that are part of the Star Wars galaxy. During this
		activity, your team will write a Python program that uses the
		<code>requests</code> module to retrieve data from the swapi
		service.</p>

		<h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
		<p>The Python <code>requests</code> module contains functions to
		send http requests for data to computer servers on the internet
		and to read the data that a server returns. Read about the
		requests module at <a target="_blank"
		href="https://requests.readthedocs.io#requests-http-for-humans">requests.readthedocs.io</a></p>

		<p>The Star Wars API (swapi) maintains lots of data about the
		ficitional Star Wars galaxy. Read about swapi and experiment
		with it at <a target="_blank"
		href="https://swapi.co/documentation">swapi.co/documentation</a></p>

		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		Use the commodities.py program, that you downloaded during the
		checkpoint for this lesson, as a reference.




		<p>Write a Python program that reads the contents of the
		<code>quotes.txt</code> file into a list and then randomly
		chooses one of the quotes and prints it for the user to see.
		Include these two lines of code at the top of your program to
		import the functions in the <code>random</code> and
		<code>textwrap</code> modules:</p>

<pre>import random
import textwrap</pre>

		<h3>Core Requirements</h3>
		<ol>
			<li><div>Your program must read the quotes from the
			<code>quotes.txt</code> file into a list and randomly choose
			one of the quotes from the list.</div></li>

			<li><div>Your program must wrap the words in the quote onto
			multiple lines if the quote is longer than 70 characters and
			then print the wrapped quote for the user to see.</div></li>

			<li><div>Your program must call the following functions:
			<ul>
				<li><div><code>open</code> - to open the
				<code>quotes.txt</code> file.</div></li>
				<li><div><code>file.readlines</code> - to read all the
				lines in the file as a list</div></li>
				<li><div><code>random.choice</code> - to randomly choose
				one of the quotes</div></li>
				<li><div><code>textwrap.wrap</code> - to wrap the words
				of the chosen quote to 70 characters or fewer per
				line</div></li>
				<li><div><code>print</code> - to print the wrapped lines
				of the quote</div></li>
			</ul></div></li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
		<p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an
		hour, complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note
		that the stretch challenges are optional.</p>

		<ol>
			<li><div>Add something or change something in your program
			that you think would make your program better, easier for
			the user, more elegant, or more fun. Be creative.</div></li>

			<li><div>Write comments above the lines of code that were
			difficult for you to understand.</div></li>

			<li><div>Change the call to the <code>textwrap.wrap</code>
			function to wrap the words in the quote to 50 characters
			instead of 70.</div></li>

			<li><div>Allow the user to enter a positive integer to
			choose how quotes are chosen and printed.</div></li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Sample Solution</h2>
		<p>Please work diligently with your team for the one-hour
		meeting. After the meeting is over, please compare your approach
		to the sample solution.</p>

		<p>Please <strong>do not look at the sample solution</strong>
		until you have either finished the program or diligently worked
		for at least one hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still
		struggling to complete the assignment, you may use the sample
		solution to help you finish.</p>

		<ul class="links">
			<li>Sample solution:
			<a href="./teach_solution.py">teach_solution.py</a></li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Submission</h2>
		<p>When you have finished the activity, please report your
		progress via the associated I-Learn quiz.</p>

		<p>When asked about which of the requirements you completed,
		feel free to include any work done during the team meeting or
		after the meeting, including work done with the help of the
		sample solution, if necessary. In short, report on what you were
		able to accomplish, regardless of when you completed it or if
		you needed help from the sample solution.</p>

		<h2>Warning</h2>

You have the power to scrape data or make denial of service attacks.
This is considered bad practice, bad citizenship, may lead to locking of
your IP address.
With great power, comes great responsibility.
Stealing data and attacking sites is unethical, not what a disciple of
Jesus Christ would do, and is violation of the BYU-Idaho honor
code .
