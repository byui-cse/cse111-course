    <h1>04 Team Activity: Retrieve Star Wars Data from a Web Server</h1>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Arrange a one hour synchronous meeting with your team for this
    activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing meeting.
    Campus students will use class time for this meeting. You should
    prepare for this meeting by completing the preparation material and
    the individual checkpoint assignment beforehand.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Star Wars is a series of movies about fictional characters and
    events that lived and happened a long time ago in a galaxy far far
    away. Because the movies are popular, there are many fan websites
    that contain information about the movies. <a target="_blank"
    href="swapi.co">swapi.co</a> is a Star Wars fan site that maintains
    a web service that contains lots of data gleaned from the movies and
    books about the fictional characters and places that are part of the
    Star Wars galaxy. During this activity, your team will write a
    Python program that uses the <code>requests</code> module to
    retrieve data from the swapi web service.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>

    <p>The <a target="_blank"
    href="https://requests.readthedocs.io#requests-http-for-humans"><code>requests</code>
    module</a> contains functions to send HTTP requests for data to
    a computer server on the internet and to read the data that the
    server returns.</p>

    <p>The Star Wars API (swapi) maintains lots of data about the
    fictional Star Wars galaxy. The <a target="_blank"
    href="https://swapi.co/documentation">official documentation</a> for
    swapi contains a tutorial, tools to experiment with swapi, and
    reference content.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Open the <a target="_blank"
    href="https://swapi.co/documentation">Star Wars API documentation</a>
    in your browser. From the documentation you can read that this URL
    <a target="_blank"
    href="https://swapi.co/api/planets">https://swapi.co/api/planets</a>
    will return data about all the planets in the Star Wars galaxy, and
    this URL <a target="_blank"
    href="https://swapi.co/api/planets">https://swapi.co/api/planets/{i}</a>,
    where <var>{i}</var> is an integer, will return data about an
    individual planet.</p>

    <p>Use the <code>commodities.py</code> program, that you downloaded
    during this lesson's checkpoint, as a reference, and write a Python
    program to retrieve the population for each planet and calculate and
    display the total population of all planets in the Star Wars
    galaxy.</p>

    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Your program must use the <code>requests</code> module
        to retrieve data from this URL: <a target="_blank"
        href="https://swapi.co/api/planets">https://swapi.co/api/planets</a>
        and then get the count of planets from that data.</div></li>

        <li><div>Your program must contain a loop that repeats once for
        each planet. Within that loop your program must use the
        <code>requests</code> module to retrieve the data for each
        planet and then get the population from that data and add that
        population into a total population.</div></li>

        <li><div>Your program must print the total population.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an hour,
    complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that the
    stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Add something or change something in your program that
        you think would make your program better, easier for the user,
        more elegant, or more fun. Be creative.</div></li>

        <li><div>Write comments above the lines of code that were
        difficult for you to understand.</div></li>

        <li><div>Change your program to count the number of planets that
        are known to have surface water.</div></li>

        <li><div>Change your program to compute the average height for
        all the characters in the swapi database.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="testing">
        <li><div>Run your program. Ensure that your program's output
        matches the sample run output, including the total population of
        the planets.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
    <a download href="teach_solution.py">sample solution</a>. Please
    <strong>do not look at the sample solution</strong> until you have
    either finished the program or diligently worked for at least one
    hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling to
    complete the assignment, you may use the sample solution to help you
    finish.</p>

    <h2>Warning</h2>
    <p> With great power, comes great responsibility. Now that you know
    how to use the <code>requests</code> module to retrieve data, you
    have enough knowledge to launch a denial of service (DOS) attack
    against a web server. If you write a program that quickly makes
    thousands or millions of requests to a server, your program's
    requests will overwhelm the server. Then other programs that are
    making normal, legitimate requests will not be served because the
    server is too busy with the flood of requests from your program.
    This is a denial of service attack. Don't do this. Launching a DOS
    attack, either purposefully or accidentally, will lead to your
    computer's IP address being blocked on the server which means the
    server will refuse to serve your computer. Launching a DOS attack is
    rude, unethical, likely illegal, a violation of the BYU-Idaho honor
    code, and not something that a disciple of Jesus Christ would
    knowingly do.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
