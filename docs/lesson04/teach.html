    <h1>04 Team Activity: Writing Functions</h1>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Arrange a one hour synchronous meeting with your team for this
    activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing meeting.
    Campus students will use class time for this meeting. You should
    prepare for this meeting by completing the preparation material and
    the individual checkpoint assignment beforehand.</p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>Strengthen your understanding of user-defined functions,
    parameters, arguments, and local variable scope by writing a program
    that has three or more functions.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>In many countries, food is stored in steel cans (also known as
    tin cans) that are shaped like cylinders. There are many different
    sizes of steel cans. The <dfn>storage efficiency</dfn> of a can
    tells us how much a can stores versus how much steel is required to
    make the can. Some sizes of cans require a lot of steel to store a
    small amount of food. Other sizes of cans require less steel and
    store more food. A can size with a large storage efficiency is
    considered more friendly to the environment than a can size with a
    small storage efficiency.</p>

    <p>The storage efficiency of a steel can is computed by dividing the
    volume of a can by its surface area.</p>

    <div class="block formula"><var>storage_efficiency</var> = <div class="fract"><div><var>volume</var></div><div><var>surface_area</var></div></div></div>

    <p>In other words, the storage efficiency of a can is the space
    inside the can divided by the amount of steel required to make the
    can. The formulas for the volume and surface area of a cylinder
    are:</p>

    <div class="block formula"><var>volume</var> = &pi;&thinsp;<var>radius</var><sup>2</sup>&thinsp;<var>height</var></div>
    <div class="block formula"><var>surface_area</var> = 2&pi;&thinsp;<var>radius</var>&thinsp;(<var>radius</var> + <var>height</var>)</div>

    <ul>
        <li><div>&pi; is the constant PI, the ratio of the circumference
        of a circle divided by its diameter (use
        <code>math.pi</code>)</div></li>
        <li><div><var>radius</var> is the radius of the cylinder</div></li>
        <li><div><var>height</var> is the height of the cylinder</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <ul class="long">
        <li><div>The prepare content for the previous lesson explains
        how to <a href="../lesson03/prepare.html">write
        functions</a>.</div></li>

        <li><div>The prepare content for this lesson explains
        <a href="prepare.html">local variable scope</a>.</div></li>

        <li><div>The Python
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html"><code>math</code>

    </ul>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Write a Python program named <code>can_sizes.py</code> that
    computes and prints the storage efficiency for each of the following
    12 steel can sizes. Then visually examine the output and answer this
    question, "Which can size has the highest storage efficiency?"</p>

    <p>If you separate your program into functions, this problem will be
    much easier to solve than if you don't separate it into functions.
    You are free to write any functions that you choose in your program,
    but we <em>strongly</em> suggest that your program include at least
    these three functions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><div><code>main</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>compute_volume</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>compute_surface_area</code></div></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Your program must compute the volume of all 12 can
        sizes.</div></li>
        <li><div>Your program must compute the surface area of all 12
        can sizes.</div></li>
        <li><div>Your program must compute and print the storage
        efficiency of all 12 can sizes.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an hour,
    complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that the
    stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Add another function named
        <code>compute_storage_efficiency</code> to your program. This
        function should call the <code>compute_volume</code>
        and <code>compute_surface_area</code> functions and
        then compute and return the storage efficiency of a steel can
        size. Replace code in the <code>main</code> function with a call
        to the <code>compute_storage_efficiency</code> function as
        appropriate. Did adding and calling the
        <code>compute_storage_efficiency</code> function reduce the
        number of lines of code in your program?</div></li>

        <li><div>The table of can sizes that appears in the Assignment
        section above includes a column that contains the cost per can
        of each steel can size. Add another function to your program
        named <code>compute_cost_efficiency</code> that computes and
        returns the volume of a steel can divided by its cost. Write
        code to call the <code>compute_cost_efficiency</code> function
        and print the cost efficiency for each can size. Then visually
        examine the output and answer this question, "Which can size has
        the highest cost efficiency?"</div></li>

        <li><div>If you remember how to use lists and a for loop from
        CSE&nbsp;110, rewrite your <code>main</code> function so that it
        uses a list that contains the can size names and dimensions.
        Then write a loop that processes the values in the
        list.</div></li>

        <li><div>Add <code>if</code> statements inside the loop to
        automatically determine which can size has the best storage
        efficiency and which can size has the best cost
        efficiency.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="testing">
        <li><div>Run your program and verify that it prints the correct
        results, rounded and formatted as shown below.

    <pre class="console">&gt; python can_sizes.py
#1 Picnic 2.0
#1 Tall 2.4
#2 2.5
#2.5 2.8
#3 Cylinder 3.4
#5 3.4
#6Z 1.7
#8Z short 1.8
#10 4.2
#211 2.2
#300 2.3
#303 2.3</pre>
        </div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
    <a class="solution" href="teach_solution.py">sample solution</a>
    or the
    <a class="solution" href="teach_stretch.py">stretch solution</a>.
    Please <strong>do not look at the sample solution</strong> until you
    have either finished the program or diligently worked for at least
    one hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling to
    complete the assignment, you may use the sample solution to help you
    finish.</p>

    <h3>Call Graph</h3>
    <p>The following call graph shows the function calls and returns in
    the sample solution for this assignment. From this call graph we see
    that the computer starts executing the sample program by calling the
    <code>main</code> function. While executing the <code>main</code>
    function, the computer calls the <code>compute_volume</code>,
    <code>compute_surface_area</code>, and <code>print</code>
    functions.</p>

        title="A function call graph for this assignment">
    </div>

    <h2>Ponder</h2>
    <p>After you finish this assignment, congratulate yourself because
    you wrote a Python program with at least three user-defined
    functions. As you wrote your program, what did you learn about
    organizing a program into functions?</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
