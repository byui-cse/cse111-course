    <h1>04 Prove Assignment: Calling Functions</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a Python program that calls functions
    and methods.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>A local grocery store subscribes to an online service that
    enables their customers to order groceries online. After a customer
    completes an order, the online service sends a CSV file to the
    grocery store. The store needs you to write a program that reads the
    CSV file and prints (to the terminal window) a receipt that lists
    the purchased items and shows the subtotal, the sales tax amount,
    and the total.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>During the prove assignment for lesson 3, you wrote the part of
    this program that reads and processes two CSV files, one named
    <code>products.csv</code> that contains a catalog of products and
    one named <code>request.csv</code> that contains a customer's
    order. During this assignment (lesson 4), you will add code to
    finish printing a receipt. Specifically, your program must do the
    following:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Print the store name at the top of the receipt.</div></li>
        <li><div>Print the list of ordered items.</div></li>
        <li><div>Sum and print the number of ordered items.</div></li>
        <li><div>Sum and print the subtotal due.</div></li>
        <li><div>Compute and print the sales tax amount. Use 6% as the
        sales tax rate.</div></li>
        <li><div>Compute and print the total amount due.</div></li>
        <li><div>Print a thank you message.</div></li>
        <li><div>Get the current date and time from your computer's
        operating system and print the current date and time.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Run</h2>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <p>The <a target="_blank" href="prepare.html">prepare</a> content
    for this lesson includes lots of information about calling functions
    and methods.</p>

    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://content.byui.edu/items/a9e60503-b5e7-40f0-bf48-ebf1a7441d25/1/example_04.mp4">This video</a>
    shows a BYU-Idaho faculty member writing code that prints the
    current date and time formatted so that users can easily read
    it.</p>

    <p>The <code>datetime</code> module contains the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.now"><code>now</code> method</a>,
    which will get the current date and time from your computer's
    operating system. To get the current date and time from your
    computer's operating system, import the <code>datetime</code> module
    and add this code to your program:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
import datetime

# Get the current date and time from the datetime
# module which gets it from the operating system.
current_date_and_time = datetime.datetime.now()
</pre></div>

    <p>After the computer executes the above code, the variable
    <var>current_date_and_time</var> will hold the current date and
    time. You can then add code to call the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.strftime"><code>strftime</code> method</a>,
    which will format a date and time into a string that is easily
    readable by a user. For example:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
import datetime

# Get the current date and time from the datetime
# module which gets it from the operating system.
current_date_and_time = datetime.datetime.now()

# Format the current date and time to include only
# the day of the week, the hour, and the minute.
string = <em>current_date_and_time.strftime("%A %I:%M %p")</em>

# Print the formatted string.
print(string)</pre></div>

    <p>In the previous example, the string sequences that begin with the
    percent symbol (%) are called format codes. The
    <code>strftime</code> format codes and their meaning are listed in
    <a target="blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes">this document</a>.
    When executed, the previous example will print the current date and
    time to the terminal window like this:</p>

<pre class="console">&gt; python example.py
Tuesday 01:23 PM</pre>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>

    <ol class="test long">
        <li><div>Run your program and verify that it computes the
        number of items, subtotal, sales tax, and total as shown in the
        "Sample Run" section above.</div></li>

        <li><div>Verify that your program prints a receipt formatted
        exactly like the one shown in the "Sample Run" section above,
        except the last line with the date and time will have a
        different value and may be formatted differently.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>To submit your program, return to I-Learn and do these two
    things:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Upload your program (the .py file) for feedback.</div></li>
        <li><div>Add a submission comment that specifies the grading
        category that best describes your program along with a one or
        two sentence justification for your choice. The grading criteria
        are:
        <ul>
            <li><div>1. Some attempt made</div></li>
            <li><div>2. Developing but significantly deficient</div></li>
            <li><div>3. Slightly deficient</div></li>
            <li><div>4. Meets requirements</div></li>
            <li><div>5. Exceeds requirements</div></li>
        </ul></div></li>
    </ol>
