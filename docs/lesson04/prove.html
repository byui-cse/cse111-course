    <h1>04 Prove Assignment: Calling Functions</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a Python program that calls functions
    and methods.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>A local grocery store subscribes to an online service that
    enables their customers to order groceries online. After a customer
    completes an order, the online service sends a CSV file to the
    grocery store. The store needs you to write a program that reads the
    CSV file and prints (to the terminal window) a receipt that lists
    the purchased items and shows the subtotal, the sales tax amount,
    and the total.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <p>The <a target="_blank" href="prepare.html">prepare</a> content
    for this lesson includes lots of information about calling functions
    and methods.</p>

    <p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>During the prove assignment for lesson 3, you wrote the part of
    this program that reads and processes two CSV files, one named
    <code>products.csv</code> that contains a catalog of products and
    one named <code>request.csv</code> that contains a customer's
    order. During this assignment (lesson 4), you will add code to
    finish printing a receipt. Specifically, your program must do the
    following:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Print the store name at the top of the receipt.</div></li>
        <li><div>Print the list of ordered items.</div></li>
        <li><div>Sum and print the number of ordered items.</div></li>
        <li><div>Sum and print the subtotal due.</div></li>
        <li><div>Compute and print the sales tax amount. Use 6% as the
        sales tax rate.</div></li>
        <li><div>Compute and print the total amount due.</div></li>
        <li><div>Print a thank you message.</div></li>
        <li><div>Get the current date and time from your computer's
        operating system and print the current date and time.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>To get the current date and time from your computer's operating
    system, import the <code>datetime</code> module and add this code to
    your program:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
# Get the current date and time from the operating system.
now = datetime.datetime.now()
</pre></div>

    <p>After the computer executes the above code, the variable
    <var>now</var> will hold the current date and time. You can then add
    code to call the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.strftime"><code>strftime</code></a>
    method which will format the date and time into a string which your
    program can print.</p>

    <h2>Sample Run</h2>
<pre class="console">&gt; python receipt.py
Inkom Emporium

1 gallon milk: 2 @ 2.85
32 oz granola: 1 @ 3.21
1 cup yogurt: 4 @ 0.75
twix candy bar: 2 @ 0.85

Number of Items: 9
Subtotal: 13.61
Sales Tax: 0.82
Total: 14.43

Thank you for shopping at the Inkom Emporium.

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>

    <ol class="test long">
        <li><div>Run your program and verify that it computes the
        number of items, subtotal, sales tax, and total as shown in the
        "Sample Run" section above.</div></li>

        <li><div>Verify that your program prints a receipt formatted
        exactly like the one shown in the "Sample Run" section above,
        except the last line with the date and time will have a
        different value and may be formatted differently.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>To submit your program, return to I-Learn and do these two
    things:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Upload your program (the .py file) for feedback.</div></li>
        <li><div>Add a submission comment that specifies the grading
        category that best describes your program along with a one or
        two sentence justification for your choice. The grading criteria
        are:
        <ul>
            <li><div>1. Some attempt made</div></li>
            <li><div>2. Developing but significantly deficient</div></li>
            <li><div>3. Slightly deficient</div></li>
            <li><div>4. Meets requirements</div></li>
            <li><div>5. Exceeds requirements</div></li>
        </ul></div></li>
    </ol>
