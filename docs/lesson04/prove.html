		<h1>04 Prove: Assignment</h1>

		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Prove that you can write a Python program that calls
		third-party functions.</p>

		<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
		<p>The weather affects people's lives for good and bad every
		day. Because of the impact of the weather on people's lives, the
		United States Federal Government sponsors the U.S. National
		Weather Service which forecasts the weather throughout the
		entire United States every day. These weather forecasts are
		available for free as a web service on the internet. Write a
		Python program that</p>

		<ol>
			<li><div>allows a user to select a city from a list of
			cities</div></li>
			<li><div>retrieves weather forecasts for the next seven days
			and nights from the U.S. National Weather Service</div></li>
			<li><div>writes the forecasts to an HTML file that a user
			can view in a browser</div></li>
		</ol>

		<p>During lesson 3, you wrote the part of this program that
		writes a weather forecast to an HTML file. During this
		assignment (lesson 4), you will add the code to prompt the user
		for their desired city and to retrieve a forecast from the U.S.
		Weather Service.</p>

		<h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
		<p>The website <a target="_blank"
		href="https://www.latlong.net/">latlong.net</a> allows a user to
		enter the name and state of a city in the U.S. and then displays
		the latitude and longitude of that city.</p>

		<p>The Python <a target="_blank"
		href="https://requests.readthedocs.io#requests-http-for-humans"><code>requests</code> module</a>
		contains functions to send http requests for data to a computer
		server on the internet and to read the data that the server
		returns.</p>

		<p>The U.S. National Weather Service maintains a
		<a target="_blank" href="https://api.weather.gov/">service</a>
		that returns weather forecasts for cities within the United
		States. The service is documentated at <a target="_blank"
		href="https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api">www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api</a>.</p>

		<p>The Python <a target="_blank"
		href="../lesson03/weather_html.html"><code>weather_html</code> module</a>
		was written at BYU-Idaho and accepts U.S. National Weather
		Service forecasts and writes HTML to a file.</p>

		<h2>Assignment</h2>
		<p>Open your program from the prove assignment for last week and
		add the following to it:</p>

		<ol>
			<li><div>A dictionary with at least five U.S. cities and
			their corresponding latitude and longitude. A dictionary
			with this structure would work well:
			<table><thead>
				<tr><th>Keys (string)</th> <th>Values (tuple)</th></tr>
			</thead><tbody>
				<tr><td>"Dallas, Texas"</td> <td>(32.776665, -96.796989)</td></tr>
				<tr><td>"Rexburg, Idaho"</td> <td>(43.822893, -111.790988)</td></tr>
			</tbody></table></div></li>

			<li><div>Python code that allows a user to choose one of the
			cities in the dictionary.</div></li>

			<li><div>Python code that uses the <code>requests</code>
			module to retrieve the weather forecast for the city that
			the user chose.</div></li>
		</ol>

		<p>You should keep the code that you wrote last week to generate
		an HTML report. You should connect the code from step 3 above
		with the code that you wrote last week to generate an HTML
		report.</p>

		<h2>Sample Run</h2>
<pre class="console">&gt; python prove_solution.py
Choose a city:
[1] Dallas, Texas
[2] Phoenix, Arizona
[3] Rexburg, Idaho
[4] Salt Lake City, Utah
[5] San Diego, California
Enter 1 - 5: <span class="input">2</span>
Phoenix, Arizona
Forecast report written to PhoenixArizona.html</pre>

		<h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
		<p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each
		step in this testing procedure:</p>

		<ol>
			<li><div>Run your program, choose one of the cities, verify
			that your program wrote an HTML file to your computer's hard
			drive, and double click on the HTML file that you program
			produced. Double clicking the HTML file should open it in a
			browser. Look at the document in the browser and verify that
			it looks correct, including the correct city name and a
			correctly formatted five day, vertical forecast.</div></li>

			<li><div>Repeat the above step for each of the four other
			cities in your program.</div></li>

			<li><div>Repeat step 1 again for each of the five cities,
			but do it at a different time of the day. For example, if
			you first tested your program during the morning, then test
			it again in the afternoon or vice versa.</div></li>
		</ol>
