    <h1>04 Prove Assignment: Writing Functions</h1>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write functions with parameters and call those
    functions with arguments.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Modern computers are capable of performing all sorts of
    calculations to produce numbers. However, they are also capable of
    performing calculations to produce art, illustrations, animations,
    movies, and music.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>During the previous lesson's milestone, you wrote code to draw at
    least the sky, clouds, and ground of an outdoor scene. During this
    lesson, you will write code that draws the remaining objects in your
    scene. Your program can draw any outdoor scene that you like as long
    as it meets these requirements:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>The scene must be outdoor and include part of the
        sky.</div></li>
        <li><div>The sky must have clouds.</div></li>
        <li><div>The scene must include repetitive objects, such as
        blades of grass, trees, leaves on a tree, birds, flowers,
        insects, fish, pickets in a fence, dashed lines on a road,
        buildings, bales of hay, snowmen, snowflakes, or
        icicles.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Your program must be divided into functions such as
    <code>draw_sky</code>, <code>draw_cloud</code>,
    <code>draw_ground</code>, <code>draw_bird</code>,
    <code>draw_flower</code>, <code>draw_insect</code>,
    <code>draw_fish</code>, or <code>draw_snowman</code>. Each
    repetitive object in your scene should be drawn by a function that
    your program calls repeatedly, once for each repeated object. For
    example, your program could include a function named
    <code>draw_leaf</code> that your program repeatedly calls to draw
    each leaf on a tree at a different location.</p>

    <p>As you write your program, write it so that it draws objects in
    the order of farthest away to nearest. For example, you program
    should draw the sky first, then clouds, then the ground, then trees,
    then insects in the trees. Be creative.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <ul class="long">
        <li><div>The <a href="../lesson02/prepare.html">prepare content</a>
        for lesson&nbsp;2 explains how to call functions.</div></li>

        <li><div>The prepare content for the previous lesson explains how to
        <a href="../lesson03/prepare.html">write functions</a>.</div></li>

        <li><div>The prepare content for this lesson lesson explains the
        <a href="prepare.html#func_design">properties of a good function</a>.
        </div></li>

        <li><div>The <a href="../lesson03/prove.html">prove milestone</a>
        of the previous lesson describes this assignment in more detail
        and contains additional
        <a href="../lesson03/prove.html#docs">helpful documentation</a>.
        </div></li>

        <li><div>The documentation for the Draw 2D library includes
        <a href="../lesson03/draw2d.html#examples">example programs</a>, a
        <a href="../lesson03/draw2d.html#functions">function reference</a>,
        and a table of
        <a href="../lesson03/draw2d.html#colors">supported colors</a>.
        </div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="test">
        <li><div>Run your program and verify that it correctly opens a
        window and draws within that window a complete outdoor scene
        that contains the sky, clouds, the ground, and other
        elements.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Exceeding the Requirements</h2>
    <p>If you wish to exceed the requirements of this assignment, you
    could write code to add more items to your scene. The most efficient
    way to add more items to your scene is to write a function that
    draws something, such as <code>draw_pebble</code>,
    <code>draw_snowman</code>, or <code>draw_fish</code> and then call
    that function many times in your <code>draw_scene</code> function.
    Exceeding the requirements of this assignment is optional.</p>

    <h2>Ponder</h2>
    <p>After you finish this assignment, congratulate yourself because
    you wrote a Python program with many user-defined functions. As you
    wrote your program, what did you learn about organizing a program
    into functions? Did you learn that you can work more efficiently by
    writing a function once and calling it many times with different
    arguments?</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>To submit your program, return to I-Learn and do these two
    things:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Upload your program (the .py file) for feedback.</div></li>
        <li><div>Add a submission comment that specifies the grading
        category that best describes your program along with a one or
        two sentence justification for your choice. The grading criteria
        are:
        <ol>
            <li><div>Some attempt made</div></li>
            <li><div>Developing but significantly deficient</div></li>
            <li><div>Slightly deficient</div></li>
            <li><div>Meets requirements</div></li>
            <li><div>Exceeds requirements</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>
    </ol>
