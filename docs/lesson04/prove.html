		<h1>03 Prove: Assignment Milestone</h1>

		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Prove that you can write a Python program that calls built-in
		and standard functions.</p>

		<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
		<p>The weather affects people's lives for good and bad every
		day. Because of the impact of the weather on people's lives, the
		United States Federal Government sponsors the U.S. National
		Weather Service which forecasts the weather throughout the
		entire United States every day. These weather forecasts are
		available for free as a web service on the internet. Write a
		Python program that</p>

		<ol>
			<li><div>allows a user to select a city from a list of
			cities</div></li>
			<li><div>retrieves weather forecasts for the next seven days
			and nights from the U.S. National Weather Service</div></li>
			<li><div>writes the forecasts to an HTML file that a user
			can view in a browser</div></li>
		</ol>

		<p>During lesson 3, you will write half of this Python program.
		This half will not retrieve the forecast from the U.S. Weather
		Service but will instead use two sets of test forecasts and will
		write those forecasts to an HTML file. During lesson 4, you will
		add the code to prompt the user for their desired city and to
		retrieve the forecasts from the U.S. Weather Service.</p>

		<h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
		<p>The Python weather_html module was written at BYU-Idaho and
		accepts U.S. National Weather Service data and writes HTML to a
		file. To prepare for this assignment, read about <a
		target="_blank" href="weather_html.html">weather_html module</a> and its
		functions.</p>

		<h2>Assignment</h2>
		<p>Download both of these files:
		<a target="_blank" download href="weather_html.py">weather_html.py</a>
		<a target="_blank" download href="test_periods.py">test_periods.py</a>
		and save them into the same folder where you will save your
		Python program. Open the <code>weather_html.py</code> file and
		examine it. Notice that this file is the weather_html module and
		contains the four functions: <code>create_report</code>,
		<code>add_row</code>, <code>add_period</code>,
		<code>write_report</code> that are described in the module's
		documentation. Open the <code>test_periods.py</code> file and
		notice that it contains two lists:
		<code>periods_that_start_with_a_day</code> and
		<code>periods_that_start_with_a_night</code>. You will use these
		two lists to test your program during week 3.</p>

		<p>Write a Python program that creates a weather forecast report
		in one of these three formats:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><div>horizontal three day</div></li>
			<li><div>vertical five day</div></li>
			<li><div>horizontal seven day</div></li>
		</ul>

		<p>All three of these formats are shown in this table.</p>
		<table><thead>
			<tr><th></th> <th>periods_that_<br>start_with_a_day</th>
				<th>periods_that_<br>start_with_a_night</th></tr>
		</thead><tbody>
			<tr><th>horizontal three day</th>
				<td><a target="_blank" href="forecast3day.html">forecast3day.html</a></td>
				<td><a target="_blank" href="forecast3night.html">forecast3night.html</a></td></tr>
			<tr><th>vertical five day</th>
				<td><a target="_blank" href="forecast5day.html">forecast5day.html</a></td>
				<td><a target="_blank" href="forecast5night.html">forecast5night.html</a></td></tr>
			<tr><th>horizontal seven day</th>
				<td><a target="_blank" href="forecast7day.html">forecast7day.html</a></td>
				<td><a target="_blank" href="forecast7night.html">forecast7night.html</a></td></tr>
		</tbody></table>

		<p>Use this code to begin your Python program</p>
<pre>import test_periods
import weather_html

city_name = "Rexburg, Idaho"
periods = test_periods.periods_that_start_with_a_day
# periods = test_periods.periods_that_start_with_a_night
</pre>

		<p>Finish your program by writing code to call the four
		functions from the <code>weather_html</code> module as necessary
		to produce an HTML file in one of the three formats shown in the
		above table.</p>

		<h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
		<p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each
		step in this testing procedure:</p>

		<ol>
			<li><div>Run your program and double click on the HTML file
			that you program produces. Double clicking the HTML file
			should open it in a browser. Look at the document in the
			browser and verify that it looks matches the corresponding
			document from the table above.</div></li>

			<li><div>Change your program to use the list
			<code>periods_that_start_with_a_night</code> and then run
			your program again. Double click on the HTML file and verify
			that the document changed and that it looks matches the
			corresponding document from the table above.</div></li>
		</ol>
