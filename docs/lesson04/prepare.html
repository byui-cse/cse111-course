    <h1>04 Prepare: Calling Third-Party Functions</h1>

    <p>Because most useful computer programs are very large,
    programmers divide their programs into parts. Dividing a program
    into parts makes it easier to write, debug, and understand the
    program. A programmer can divide a Python program into modules,
    classes, and functions. In this lesson, you will learn how to
    call existing functions in third-party modules, and in the next
    unit, you will learn how to write your own functions.</p>

    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn this week:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>A <dfn>function</dfn> is a group of statements
        (computer commands) that together perform one
        task.</div></li>

        <li><div>A Python <dfn>module</dfn> is collection of related
        functions.</div></li>

        <li><div>Python includes many standard modules, such as
        <code>csv</code>, <code>datetime</code>, <code>math</code>,
        <code>random</code>, and <code>textwrap</code>.
        You can read the documentation for the standard modules in the
        <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/">official
        online Python documentation</a></a></div></li>

        <li><div>There are many modules that are not part of the
        standard Python modules. These additional modules are
        sometimes called third-party modules and are written and
        maintained by other people as a service to the Python
        community. Third-party modules are usually available at no
        cost.</div></li>

        <li><div><a target="_blank" href="https://pypi.org/">The Python
        package index</a> (pypi) is an online repository of software
        that contains more than 200,000 software packages, each of which
        contains one or more third-party Python modules.</div></li>

        <li><div><code>pip</code> is a computer command that you can
        use to download and install third-party modules. During this
        course, you will use <code>pip</code> to download and
        install several third-party modules.</div></li>

        <li><div>A programmer (you) can save lots of time by using
        existing modules.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>To learn more about installing modules using the <code>pip</code>
    command, watch this video and read the official
    <a target="_blank"
    href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html"><code>pip</code>
    documentation</a>.</p>
