    <h1>04 Prepare: Calling Third-Party Functions</h1>

    <p>Because most useful computer programs are very large, programmers
    divide their programs into parts. Dividing a program into parts
    makes it easier to write, debug, and understand the program. A
    programmer can divide a Python program into modules, classes, and
    functions. In this lesson, you will learn how to call existing
    functions in third-party modules, and in the next unit, you will
    learn how to write your own functions.</p>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn during this lesson:</p>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>A <dfn>function</dfn> is a group of statements
        (computer commands) that together perform one task.</div></li>

        <li><div>A Python <dfn>module</dfn> is collection of related
        functions.</div></li>

        <li><div>Python includes many standard modules, such as
        <code>csv</code>, <code>datetime</code>, <code>math</code>,
        <code>random</code>, and <code>textwrap</code>. You can read the
        documentation for the standard modules in the official
        <a target="_blank"
        href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/">Python
        reference</a>.</div></li>

        <li><div><a target="_blank"
        href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html"><code>pip</code></a>
        is a standard Python module that you can use to download and
        install third-party modules. During this course, you will use
        <code>pip</code> to download and install several third-party
        modules.</div></li>

        <li><div>There are many modules that are not part of the
        standard Python modules. These additional modules are sometimes
        called third-party modules and are written and maintained by
        other people as a service to the Python community. Third-party
        modules are usually available at no cost.</div></li>

        <li><div>The <a target="_blank" href="https://pypi.org/">Python
        package index</a> (pypi) is an online repository of software
        that contains more than 200,000 software packages, each of which
        contains one or more third-party Python modules.</div></li>

        <li><div>The <a target="_blank"
        href="https://requests.readthedocs.io#requests-http-for-humans"><code>requests</code>
        module</a> contains functions to send HTTP requests for data to
        a computer server on the internet and to read the data that the
        server returns.</div></li>

        <li><div>A programmer (you) can save lots of time by using
        existing modules.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <p>To learn more about installing modules using the <code>pip</code>
    command, read the <a target="_blank"
    href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html#basic-usage">Basic
    usage</a> section of the official <code>pip</code> reference.</p>
