    <h1>11 Team Activity: Functional Programming</h1>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Arrange a one hour synchronous meeting with your team for this
    activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing meeting.
    Campus students will use class time for this meeting. You should
    prepare for this meeting by completing the preparation material and
    the individual checkpoint assignment beforehand.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>In the United States, minor students are required by law to
    attend school. There are 13 grade levels for students. Usually
    students are assigned to a grade level based on their age on a
    specific cutoff date, which is often October 1. Ages and grade
    levels are shown in the following table:</p>

    <table><thead>
        <tr><th>Age<br>(years)</th> <th>Grade Level</th></tr>
    </thead><tbody>
        <tr><td class="number">5</td> <td>kindergarten</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="number">6</td> <td>first</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="number">7</td> <td>second</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="number">8</td> <td>third</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="number">9</td> <td>fourth</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="number">10</td> <td>fifth</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="number">11</td> <td>sixth</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="number">12</td> <td>seventh</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="number">13</td> <td>eighth</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="number">14</td> <td>freshman</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="number">15</td> <td>sophomore</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="number">16</td> <td>junior</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="number">17</td> <td>senior</td></tr>
    <tbody></table>

    <p>As an example, a student who is 7 years old on October 1 would be
    assigned to second grade.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <ul class="long">
        <li><div>The prepare content for this lesson explains Python
        <a href="prepare.html#lambda">lambda functions</a>
        and the pandas
        <a href="prepare.html#apply"><code>apply</code> function</a>.</div></li>

        <li><div>The official pandas reference for the
        <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.apply.html"><code>apply</code> function</a>
        briefly explains the <code>args</code> named parameter.</div></li>

        <li><div>The <a href="../lesson09/prepare.html">prepare content</a>
        for the first pandas lesson contains sample code for adding a
        new column to a DataFrame and for counting values in a
        DataFrame.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Do the following:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Download these two files:
        <a download href="students.csv">students.csv</a> and
        <a download href="grade_level.py">grade_level.py</a>
        and save them in the same folder.</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the <code>students.csv</code> file in VS Code and
        notice that it has six columns: givenName, surname, birthdate,
        parentGivenName, parentSurname, phone. Your program will add two
        more columns named ageAtCutoff and gradeLevel.</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the <code>grade_level.py</code> file in VS Code.
        Read the comments in the program and then complete the program
        by replacing each <code>pass</code> statement with the correct
        Python code.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Your finished grade_level.py program must contain at
        least the following:
        <ol>
            <li><div>four regular functions named <code>main</code>,
            <code>add_columns</code>, <code>year_diff</code>, and
            <code>grade_level_counts</code></div></li>
            <li><div>one lambda function</div></li>
            <li><div>two calls to the pandas <code>apply</code>
            function</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>

        <li><div>Your program must add to the original data frame two
        columns named ageAtCutoff and gradeLevel and must print the data
        frame.</div></li>

        <li><div>Your program must create and print a new pandas Series
        that contains a count of the number of students assigned to each
        grade level.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an
    hour, complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that
    the stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Before printing the students data frame, sort it by
        ageAtCutoff, surname, and givenName.</div></li>

        <li><div>Before printing the grade level counts series, sort it
        by the normal ordering of grade levels which is shown in this
        assignment in the table above.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="test long">
        <li><div>Download, examine, and run this Python file named
        <a download href="test_grade_level.py"><code>test_grade_level.py</code></a>
        that contains <code>pytest</code> test functions. Verify that
        all the test functions pass. If they don't pass, fix the
        mistakes in your code until they do pass.</div></li>

        <li><div>Run your program. Ensure that your program's output
        is similar to the sample run output.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
    <a download href="teach_solution.py">sample solution</a>. Please
    <strong>do not look at the sample solution</strong> until you have
    either finished the program or diligently worked for at least one
    hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling to
    complete the assignment, you may use the sample solution to help you
    finish.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
