    <h1>11 Checkpoint: Fix Phone Numbers</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Complete this individual checkpoint assignment to reinforce in
    your mind the concept that a function can be passed as an argument
    to another function.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Phone numbers in the U.S. are often stored as ten digits and
    two dashes in this format: "ddd-ddd-dddd" where each <var>d</var> is
    a digit. The first three digits are called the area code. For
    example, for many years, 208 was the area code for all phone numbers
    from the state of Idaho and 801 and 435 were the two area codes for
    phone numbers in the state of Utah. Some people when entering their
    phone number will not enter the area code and assume that other
    people will know the correct area code.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><div>pandas <a target="_blank" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.apply.html"><code>apply</code></a> function</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Do the following:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Download these two files:
        <a download href="students.csv">students.csv</a> and
        <a download href="add_area_code.py">add_area_code.py</a>
        and save them in the same folder.</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the <code>students.csv</code> file in VS Code and
        examine the phone numbers in the "phone" column. Notice that
        some of the phone numbers do not contain an area code and
        contain only seven digits.</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the <code>add_area_code.py</code> file in VS Code.
        Read the comments in the program and then add code to the
        program so that it does the following:
        <ol>
            <li><div>Read the data in <code>students.csv</code> into a
            DataFrame.</div></li>
            <li><div>Add the area code "208-" to the phone numbers that
            do not contain an area code.</div></li>
            <li><div>Write the data to a new file named
            <code>students2.csv</code>.</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>

    <ol class="test long">
        <li><div>Run your program which should create a file named
        <code>students2.csv</code> and then open the
        <code>students2.csv</code> file.</div></li>

        <li><div>In the <code>students2.csv</code> file, examine the
        phone numbers in the "phone" column and verify that all phone
        numbers have an area code and are ten digits long in this
        format: ddd-ddd-dddd where each <var>d</var> is a
        digit.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Ponder</h2>
    <p>In the <code>main</code> function, look at the line of code that
    calls the pandas <code>apply</code> function. Think about the fact
    that the <code>apply</code> function will call the
    <code>add_area_code</code> function once for each phone number in
    the "phone" column, and the <code>add_area_code</code> function will
    add Idaho's area code "208-" at the beginning of the phone number if
    necessary.</p>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>When your program is finished, view the <a download
    href="check_solution.py">sample solution</a> for this assignment to
    compare your solution to that one. Before looking at the sample
    solution, you should work to complete this checkpoint program first.
    However, if you have worked on it for at least an hour and are still
    having problems, feel free to use the sample solution to help you
    finish your program.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When complete, report your progress in the associated I-Learn
    quiz.</p>
