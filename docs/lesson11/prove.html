    <h1>11 Prove Milestone: Significant Python Program</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can develop a significant Python program with
    multiple functions that you verify are correct with test functions
    and <code>pytest</code>.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>During this lesson and the next two lessons, write a significant
    Python program that does something that interests you. You may
    choose one of the programs from the list below, or you may write a
    program that you design. However, if you intend to write a program
    that is not in the list below, <strong>you must first propose your
    program</strong> to your instructor.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><div>A program that uses <code>pandas</code> to process a
        dataset like the water meter reading dataset and produces charts
        that help people to visualize information about the
        dataset.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program with a complete graphical user interface
        (GUI), including windows, frames, labels, text fields, and
        buttons. Use <code>tkinter</code> or <code>kivy</code>.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that stores and retrieves data from a
        relational database.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that stores and retrieves data from a
        Firebase database.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that graphically simulates the spread of a
        disease like the simulations in this <a target="_blank"
        href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/">Washington
        Post article</a>. Your program should include variables that can
        be changed, such as movement rate, probability of transmission,
        length of contagiousness, length of illness, and probability of
        death.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that reads an English text file and respells
        the words to more closely match their pronunciation. For more
        information, see the <a target="_blank"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language_spelling_reform">English-language
        spelling reform</a> article at Wikipedia.</div></li>

        <li><div></div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Organization</h2>
    <p>As you develop your program, be certain to divide the program
    into functions. Each function should perform a single task and
    should be appropriately named.</p>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>As you develop your program, write test functions that test your
    program functions. Run the test functions using <code>pytest</code>
    to verify the correctness of your program functions.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>At the end of each lesson: 11, 12, and 13, you must submit the
    following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>the number of hours that you worked on your
        program</div></li>
        <li><div>a description of the progress that you made on your
        program</div></li>
        <li><div>the source code for your program and test
        functions</div></li>
    </ul>
