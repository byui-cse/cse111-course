    <h1>11 Prove Milestone: Significant Python Program</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a significant Python program that is
    well organized and solves a real-world problem. Your program must
    include multiple functions that you verify are correct with test
    functions and <code>pytest</code>.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>During this lesson and the next two lessons, write a significant
    Python program that you choose. Ideally this program will solve a
    problem or become a tool in a subject area that interests you, such
    as chemistry, physics, geography, fashion, family history,
    linguistics, social work, food science, carpentry, machinery,
    engineering, mathematics, computing, etc. Before you begin writing
    your program, you must <strong>propose your program to your
    instructor</strong> to ensure that the program is neither too easy
    nor too difficult for the time remaining in this course. If you
    finish your program more quickly than you and your instructor
    expected, and there is time remaining in this course, then choose
    and write another program.</p>

    <h2>Proposal</h2>
    <p>To write a proposal for your program, download and save this
    <a download href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse111-course/lesson11/proposal.txt">proposal.txt</a>
    file. Open the downloaded file in VS Code. Answer each of the
    questions and save your file. Then submit your proposal by uploading
    it into the first question of the Lesson&nbsp;11 Prove: Milestone
    quiz in I-Learn.</p>

    <h2>Possible Programs</h2>
    <p>If you find it difficult to choose a program to write, you may
    choose to write one of the following programs:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>A program that performs calculations that are useful in
        your major or hobby.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program with a complete graphical user interface
        (GUI), including windows, frames, labels, text fields, and
        buttons. Use <code>tkinter</code> or <code>kivy</code>. The team
        assignment in the next lesson will show you how to write code
        for a simple GUI.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that reads the text of a book and counts how
        often each word occurs in the book.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that reads English text from a file and
        converts strangely spelled words to a simpler spelling that more
        closely matches their pronunciation. Consider just a few of the
        strangely spelled English words: comb, lamb, have, done, two,
        Wednesday, should, night ("ight" is a blight on the English
        language). For more information, see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language_spelling_reform">English-language
        spelling reform</a> article at Wikipedia.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that uses <code>pandas</code> to process a
        data set like the water meter reading data set and produces
        charts that help people to visualize information about the data
        set.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program to reorganize or rename all the files in a
        collection of files, such as collection of Microsoft Word
        documents, Excel spreadsheets, music (mp3) files, pictures (jpg)
        files. If you choose to write this program, we
        <strong>strongly</strong> suggest that you make a copy of the
        files that your program will reorganize or rename and run your
        program on the copy. This is because it is highly likely that
        you will make mistakes when writing this program, and such
        mistakes may cause the files to be deleted. Really.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that graphically simulates the spread of a
        disease like the simulations in this <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/">Washington
        Post article</a>. Your program should include variables that can
        be changed, such as movement rate, probability of transmission,
        length of contagiousness, length of illness, and probability of
        death.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that retrieves data from a a server on the
        internet.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that retrieves data from a relational
        database.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that retrieves data from a Firebase
        database.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Organization</h2>
    <p>As you develop your program, be certain to divide the program
    into functions. Each function should perform a single task, be
    appropriately named, and have parameters as needed.</p>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>You should follow good coding practices by writing test functions
    and running them with <code>pytest</code> to verify that your
    program functions works correctly. Many students believe that the
    program functions they write cannot be tested with test functions
    and pytest. Such claims are simply false. Here are just some of the
    reasons that students have claimed make their program functions
    untestable and example code that shows such claims are false.</p>
