    <h1>11 Prove Milestone: Significant Python Program</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a significant Python program that is
    well organized and solves a real world problem. Your program must
    include multiple functions that you verify are correct with test
    functions and <code>pytest</code>.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>During this lesson and the next two lessons, write a significant
    Python program that you choose. Ideally this program will solve a
    problem or become a tool in a subject area that interests you, such
    as chemistry, physics, geography, fashion, family history,
    linguistics, social work, food science, carpentry, machinery,
    engineering, mathematics, computing, etc. Before you begin writing
    your program, you must <em>propose your program to your
    instructor</em> to ensure that the program is neither too easy nor
    too difficult for the time remaining in this course. If you finish
    your program more quickly than you and your instructor expected, and
    there is time remaining in this course, then choose and write
    another program.</p>

    <h2>Possible Programs</h2>
    <p>If you find it difficult to choose a program to write, you may
    choose to write one of the following programs:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>A program that uses <code>pandas</code> to process a
        dataset like the water meter reading dataset and produces charts
        that help people to visualize information about the
        dataset.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program with a complete graphical user interface
        (GUI), including windows, frames, labels, text fields, and
        buttons. Use <code>tkinter</code> or <code>kivy</code>.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that stores and retrieves data from a
        relational database.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that stores and retrieves data from a
        Firebase database.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that graphically simulates the spread of a
        disease like the simulations in this <a target="_blank"
        href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/">Washington
        Post article</a>. Your program should include variables that can
        be changed, such as movement rate, probability of transmission,
        length of contagiousness, length of illness, and probability of
        death.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that reads English text from a file and
        converts strangely spelled words to a simpler spelling that more
        closely matches their pronunciation. Consider just a few of the
        strangely spelled English words: comb, lamb, have, done, two,
        Wednesday, should, night ("ight" is a blight on the English
        language). For more information, see the <a target="_blank"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language_spelling_reform">English-language
        spelling reform</a> article at Wikipedia.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program to reorganize or rename all the files in a
        collection of files, such as collection of Microsoft Word
        documents, Excel spreadsheets, music (mp3) files, pictures (jpg)
        files. If you choose to write this program, we
        <strong>strongly</strong> suggest that you make a copy of the
        files that your program will reorganize or rename and run your
        program on the copy. This is because it is highly likely that
        you will make mistakes when writing this program, and such
        mistakes may cause the files to be deleted. Really.</div></li>

        <li><div></div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Organization</h2>
    <p>As you develop your program, be certain to divide the program
    into functions. Each function should perform a single task, be
    appropriately named, and have parameters as needed.</p>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>You should follow good coding practices by writing test functions
    and running them with <code>pytest</code> to verify that your
    program functions works correctly.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>At the end of each lesson: 11, 12, and 13, you must submit a
    description or your work, and your teacher or teaching assistant will
    grade your work according to this rubric:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Time - 50%: Did you spend at least the required hours
        on your program? For lessons 11 and 12, you should spend at
        least three hours each lesson working on your program. For
        lesson 13, you should spend at least six hours (including class
        time for face-to-face students).</div></li>

        <li><div>Organization - 20%: Is your program organized into
        multiple functions and does each function perform just one
        task?</div></li>

        <li><div>Finished Work - 20%: Did you complete some significant
        part of your program during the current lesson? A normal part of
        developing software is to develop algorithms and write code that
        is incomplete or contains mistakes. Such algorithms and code
        must be redeveloped and rewritten. It is not the goal of this
        assignment to penalize you for normal mistakes but instead to
        allow you to experiment as you write your program. However, at
        the end of each lesson, you should have accomplished some part
        of your program (including test functions) that is well written
        and significant.</div></li>

        <li><div>Description - 10%: Is the description of your work
        complete and easily understandable? At the end of each lesson,
        you will submit a description of your work. This description
        should follow normal English rules of spelling and grammar. It
        should be about 200 words long. It must include the following:
        <ol>
            <li><div>The amount of time that you spent working on your
            program during the current lesson.</div></li>
            <li><div>A list of the function names in your program.</div></li>
            <li><div>A list of the test function names in your
            test code.</div></li>
            <li><div>A list of the documentation that you read, the
            videos that you watched, and the coding experiments that you
            tried.</div></li>
            <li><div>A list of the work that you finished on your
            program.</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>
    </ol>
