Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

(This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best knowledge
at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the beginning to the
end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and some of the ideas we
proposed change. This is part of completing any project and is fine.
However, we still must write a proposal so that our teachers or
supervisors know what we intend to do. Please answer each of the
following questions to the best of your knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?

2. What real world problem will your program address or help to solve?

3. What will you learn from developing this program?

4. What Python modules will your program use? (Some examples are: csv,
datetime, functools, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest, random, requests,
and tkinter.)

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?

6. Will you write test functions to test many of your program functions?

(Remember that it's hard to test functions that get user input and print
output. It's easy to test functions that don't get user input and don't
print output but instead have parameters and return a result. Therefore,
you should write most of your program functions to have parameters and
return a result.)
