    <h1>11 Prepare: Programming with Objects</h1>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>A <a target="_blank"
    href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define+paradigm">paradigm</a>
    is a way of thinking or a way of viewing the world. There are at
    least four main paradigms for programming a computer: procedural,
    declarative, functional, and object oriented. During CSE 110 and
    111, you used or encountered the first three of these programming
    paradigms. During this lesson, you will be exposed to the last.</p>

    <h3>Procedural Programming</h3>
    <p>Procedural programming is a way of programming that focuses on
    the process or the steps to accomplish a task. For example, if we
    had 100 numbers and wanted to know the average value of those 100
    numbers, we could add the numbers and then divide by 100. This is
    one process to compute the average of numbers: add them and divide
    by the quantity of numbers. A Python procedural program for
    computing the average looks like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">numbers = [...]
total = 0
for x in number:
    total += x
average = total / len(numbers)</pre></div>

    <p>Notice that with procedural programming, we must code the process
    or the steps that are necessary to complete a task. Procedural
    programming is the type of programming that you did most often in
    CSE 110 and 111.</p>

    <h3>Declarative Programming</h3>
    <p>When we use declarative programming to program a computer, we
    don't focus on the process or steps to accomplish a task, but rather
    we focus on what we want from the task. Continuing the example of
    the average, with declarative programming, we focus on exactly what
    numbers we want the average of and then tell the computer to compute
    that average for us. Many of the commands in <code>pandas</code> are
    a form of declarative programming. For example, using
    <code>pandas</code>, we could command the computer to compute the
    average of the values in a column like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">import pandas

data = pandas.read_csv("water.csv")
average = data["usage"].mean()</pre></div>

    <p>Notice that with declarative programming, we don't write the
    steps to compute the average because someone else already did that
    for us. Instead, we focus on telling the computer what data we want
    it to average: in this example the values in the "usage" column. The
    term "declarative programming" means that we are stating or
    declaring what we want the computer to do. We are not telling the
    computer how to compute something. We are declaring what we want the
    computer to do, and the computer determines how to do it and then
    does it.</p>

    <h3>Functional Programming</h3>
    <p>When we use functional programming to program a computer, we
    focus on the functions necessary to accomplish a task.
    Mathematicians often find functional programming is natural for them
    because they are accustomed to using functions while studying
    mathematics. In functional programming, functions are so important
    that we often pass functions into other functions. You did this in
    lesson 9 when you passed a function into the pandas
    <code>apply</code> function. Here is a functional programming
    solution to computing the average in Python:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">from functools import reduce

def add(a, b):
    """Return the sum of two numbers."""
    return a + b

numbers = [...]
average = reduce(add, numbers) / len(numbers)</pre></div>

    <p>Notice how this simple example uses three functions:
    <code>reduce</code>, <code>add</code>, and <code>len</code>. Notice
    also that the <code>add</code> function is passed into the
    <code>reduce</code> function. Passing a function into a function is
    the hallmark of functional programming.</p>

    <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
    <p>With object oriented programming, we use objects to write a
    program. An object is anything in the world that has these four
    things:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>identity (a name or identification)</div></li>
        <li><div>data (also known as attributes)</div></li>
        <li><div>behavior (also known as functions)</div></li>
        <li><div>relationships to other objects</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>When we write an object oriented program we combine data and
    functions together into objects. For example, if we were writing a
    registration program used for students to register for courses at a
    school, we would create Student objects and Course objects. Each
    Student object would have data like given_name, family_name,
    phone_number, etc. and would have functions like register_for, drop,
    withdraw, etc. Each Course object would have data like course_code,
    title, description, list_of_students, etc. and would have functions
    like get_students, take_role, etc.</p>

    <p>The <code>pandas</code> module uses object oriented programming
    concepts as shown in the next code example that again computes the
    average of a list of numbers.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">import pandas

data = pandas.read_csv("water.csv")
column = data["usage"]
name = column.name
average = column.mean()
print(name, average)</pre></div>

    <p>The hallmark of object oriented programming is selecting
    attributes and calling functions using the "dot" (.) operator. The
    official name of the dot operator is "component selector", but
    almost no one calls it that because the term dot is much easier to
    say than component selector. Notice the code in the previous example
    uses the dot operator (.) to call the read_csv function in the
    pandas module, to retrieve the column's name, and to call the mean
    function in the column.</p>

    <p>Python includes many built-in and standard objects that we can
    use to help us write programs. In fact, you have already used many
    objects in your programs.</p>
