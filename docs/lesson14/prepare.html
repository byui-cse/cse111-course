    <h1>14 Prepare: Conclusion</h1>
    <p><strong>Congratulations!</strong> <em>You successfully made it to
    the final lesson of CSE 111.</em></p>

    <p>During this course you learned to write programs organized with
    functions to solve significant problems in a variety of domains,
    which was the major outcome of this course. In addition, you learned
    to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><div>Write programs that can detect and recover from invalid
        conditions (exceptions).</div></li>
        <li><div>Follow good practices in designing, writing, and
        debugging functions, including writing each function so that it
        performs one task only and writing test functions to verify that
        program functions are correct.</div></li>
        <li><div>Research modules, objects, and functions written by
        others and use them in your programs.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each of these skills will transfer to other programming languages
    that you learn in the future. Also, researching modules, objects,
    and functions written by others gave you important practice in life
    long learning. Even though the work of this course may have been
    challenging at times, you have shown skill in thinking analytically,
    breaking down problems into manageable pieces, working with others,
    and debugging abstract problems. These are skills that will transfer
    to any field of study or career path that you choose.</p>

Because this outcome of developing confidence to successfully learn new programming concepts is so important, Lesson 14 is devoted to helping you reflect and assess where you are in that development process.

To help you and the university reflect on the progress toward this outcome, you are asked to do three things during this lesson:

Write a personal reflection document.

Fill out an I-Learn Quiz as a self-assessment of this outcome.

Your responses do not affect your grade, but it helps the course designers see how successful this course was at achieve its goals.

Take a short Qualtrics survey.

Again, your responses don't affect your grade, but it helps the course designers compare course improvement progress from semester to semester.
