    <h1>06 Team Activity: Writing Text to a File</h1>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Arrange a one hour synchronous meeting with your team for this
    activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing meeting.
    Campus students will use class time for this meeting. You should
    prepare for this meeting by completing the preparation material and
    the individual checkpoint assignment beforehand.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Many programs need to read and write text to files. Often that
    text will be in languages other than English. During this
    exercise you will learn to open a <a target="_blank"
    href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-text-file">text
    file</a> and write text to it, including text in languages other
    than English. You will also learn about the optional arguments to
    the <code>open</code> function.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Write a Python program that opens a file named <code>forgive.txt</code> and writes these three strings to that file.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">english_matt_6_14 = "For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you\n"
greek_matt_6_14 = "ἐὰν γὰρ ἀφῆτε τοῖς ἀνθρώποις τὰ παραπτώματα αὐτῶν, ἀφήσει καὶ ὑμῖν ὁ πατὴρ ὑμῶν ὁ οὐράνιος\n"
deseret_3_nephi_13_14 = "𐐙𐐫𐑉, 𐐮𐑁 𐐷 𐑁𐐲𐑉𐑀𐐮𐑂 𐑋𐐯𐑌 𐑄𐐯𐑉 𐐻𐑉𐐯𐑅𐐹𐐰𐑅𐐮𐑆, 𐐷𐐫𐑉 𐐸𐐯𐑂𐐲𐑌𐑊𐐨 𐐙𐐱𐑄𐐲𐑉 𐐶𐐮𐑊 𐐫𐑊𐑅𐐬 𐑁𐐲𐑉𐑀𐐮𐑂 𐐷𐐭\n"</pre></div>

    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Your program must correctly open a text file named
        <code>forgive.txt</code> and save the English version of
        Matthew 6:14 into it.</div></li>
        <li><div>Your program must correctly save the Greek version
        of Matthew 6:14 into <code>forgive.txt</code>.</div></li>
        <li><div>Your program must correctly save the Deseret version
        of 3 Nephi 13:14 into <code>forgive.txt</code>.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an
    hour, complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that
    the stretch challenges are optional.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Add something or change something in your program that
        you think would make your program better, easier for the user,
        more elegant, or more fun. Be creative.</div></li>

        <li><div>Add code to your program so that it writes the text
        of 3 Nephi 13:14 in another language besides English, Greek,
        and Deseret.</div></li>

        <li><div>Add a feature to your program that allows the user to
        choose which language will be written to the file.</div></li>

        <li><div>Write comments above the lines of code that were
        difficult for you to understand.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="testing">
        <li><div>Run your program. It should complete without errors
        and should create a text file named
        <code>forgive.txt</code>.</div></li>
        <li><div>Open the <code>forgive.txt</code> file in VS Code.
        All the characters in <code>forgive.txt</code> should look
        the same as they look above in this web page.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one-hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
    sample solution. Please <strong>do not look at the sample
    solution</strong> until you have either finished the program or
    diligently worked for at least one hour. At the end of the hour, if
    you are still struggling to complete the assignment, you may use the
    sample solution to help you finish.</p>

    <ul class="links">
        <li>Sample solution:
        <a download href="./teach_solution.py">teach_solution.py</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
