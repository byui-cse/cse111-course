    <h1>06 Team Activity: Troubleshooting Functions</h1>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Arrange a one hour synchronous meeting with your team for this
    activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing meeting.
    Campus students will use class time for this meeting. You should
    prepare for this meeting by completing the preparation material and
    the individual checkpoint assignment beforehand.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>The Rosenberg self-esteem scale is a self-esteem measure
    developed by the sociologist Morris Rosenberg in 1965. It is still
    used in social-science research today. To complete the measure, a
    person completes a survey that contains the following ten
    statements.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>I feel that I am a person of worth, at least on an
        equal plane with others.</div></li>
        <li><div>I feel that I have a number of good qualities.</div></li>
        <li><div>All in all, I am inclined to feel that I am a
        failure.</div></li>
        <li><div>I am able to do things as well as most other
        people.</div></li>
        <li><div>I feel I do not have much to be proud of.</div></li>
        <li><div>I take a positive attitude toward myself.</div></li>
        <li><div>On the whole, I am satisfied with myself.</div></li>
        <li><div>I wish I could have more respect for myself.</div></li>
        <li><div>I certainly feel useless at times.</div></li>
        <li><div>At times I think I am no good at all.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>The person responds to each statement by choosing one of these
    four options: strongly disagree, disagree, agree, or strongly agree.
    The person's response to each statement is worth 0&ndash;3 points,
    meaning the highest possible score is
    <span class="inline expr">10 * 3 = 30</span> points. If a person
    scores lower than 15 points, the person may have a problematic low
    self-esteem.</p>

    <p>Notice that five of the statements (numbers 1, 2, 4, 6, 7) are
    positive and are scored like this:</p>
    <table class="center"><thead>
        <tr><th>Choice</th> <th>Points</th></tr>
    </thead><tbody>
        <tr><td>Strongly Disagree</td> <td class="number">0</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Disagree</td> <td class="number">1</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Agree</td> <td class="number">2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Strongly Agree</td> <td class="number">3</td></tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p>The other five statements (numbers 3, 5, 8, 9, 10) are
    negative and are scored like this:</p>
    <table class="center"><thead>
        <tr><th>Choice</th> <th>Points</th></tr>
    </thead><tbody>
        <tr><td>Strongly Disagree</td> <td class="number">3</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Disagree</td> <td class="number">2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Agree</td> <td class="number">1</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Strongly Agree</td> <td class="number">0</td></tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Write a Python program named <code>esteem.py</code> that
    implements the Rosenberg self-esteem scale. Your program must ask
    the user to respond to each of the ten statements with D, d, a, or A
    which mean strongly disagree, disagree, agree, and strongly agree.
    Your program must compute the score for each answer and sum and
    display the person's total score. It is a good idea to think about
    how you will split this program into functions before you begin
    writing the program.</p>

    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Your program prints the introductory text as shown in
        the Sample Run section below.</div></li>
        <li><div>Your program prints each of the ten statements and gets
        a response from the user.</div></li>
        <li><div>Your program computes the score for each response and
        sums all the scores and displays the total score.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an
    hour, complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that
    the stretch challenges are optional.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Write a program that implements the
        <a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/NR-6/">Nature
        Relatedness Scale</a></div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <p><a href="ttps://content.byui.edu/items/a9e60503-b5e7-40f0-bf48-ebf1a7441d25/1/debug_mpg.mp4">The video</a>
    <span class="duration">(17 minutes)</span> from the prepare content
    for this lesson shows how to use the debugger in VS Code to find
    mistakes in a program.</p>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="test long">
        <li><div>Use the debugger in VS Code to step through your
        program and verify that it works correctly.</div></li>

        <li><div>Run your <code>esteem.py</code> program. Use the input
        shown in the Sample Run section below and ensure that your
        program's output matches the sample run output.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Run</h2>
<pre class="console"> &gt; python esteem.py
This program is an implementation of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale.
This program will show you ten statements that you could possibly
apply to yourself. Please rate how much you agree with each of the
statements by responding with one of these four letters:

D means you strongly disagree with the statement.
d means you disagree with the statement.
a means you agree with the statement.
A means you strongly agree with the statement.

1. I feel that I am a person of worth, at least on an equal plane with
others.
Enter D, d, a, or A: <span class="input">A</span>
2. I feel that I have a number of good qualities.
Enter D, d, a, or A: <span class="input">A</span>
3. All in all, I am inclined to feel that I am a failure.
Enter D, d, a, or A: <span class="input">D</span>
4. I am able to do things as well as most other people.
Enter D, d, a, or A: <span class="input">a</span>
5. I feel I do not have much to be proud of.
Enter D, d, a, or A: <span class="input">d</span>
6. I take a positive attitude toward myself.
Enter D, d, a, or A: <span class="input">a</span>
7. On the whole, I am satisfied with myself.
Enter D, d, a, or A: <span class="input">a</span>
8. I wish I could have more respect for myself.
Enter D, d, a, or A: <span class="input">a</span>
9. I certainly feel useless at times.
Enter D, d, a, or A: <span class="input">a</span>
10. At times I think I am no good at all.
Enter D, d, a, or A: <span class="input">d</span>

Your score is 21.
A score below 15 may indicate problematic low self-esteem.</pre>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
    <a class="solution" href="teach_solution.py">sample solution</a>.
    Please <strong>do not look at the sample solution</strong> until you
    have either finished the program or diligently worked for at least
    one hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling to
    complete the assignment, you may use the sample solution to help you
    finish.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
