    <h1>06 Team Activity: Troubleshooting Functions</h1>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Arrange a one hour synchronous meeting with your team for this
    activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing meeting.
    Campus students will use class time for this meeting. You should
    prepare for this meeting by completing the preparation material and
    the individual checkpoint assignment beforehand.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>

    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>

    <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an
    hour, complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that
    the stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <h2>Sample Run</h2>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="test">
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to this
    <a download href="teach_solution1.py">first sample solution</a> or
    to this
    <a download href="teach_solution2.py">second sample solution</a>
    which is better organized because it is split into three more
    functions than the first solution. Please <strong>do not look at the
    sample solutions</strong> until you have either finished the program
    or diligently worked for at least one hour. At the end of the hour,
    if you are still struggling to complete the assignment, you may use
    the sample solution to help you finish.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
