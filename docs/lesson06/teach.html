    <h1>06 Team Activity: Writing Functions</h1>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Arrange a one hour synchronous meeting with your team for this
    activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing meeting.
    Campus students will use class time for this meeting. You should
    prepare for this meeting by completing the preparation material and
    the individual checkpoint assignment beforehand.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Many programs need to read and write text files. Often that text
    will be in languages other than English. Early electronic computers
    were able to process and store English characters only. In 1987,
    several individuals began investigating the possibility of a
    universal character set that would enable computers to store and
    transmit characters from all human languages. Their work led to the
    international standard known as Unicode. The Unicode standard
    assigns a unique number to every character or almost every character
    written by humans throughout the history of the world.</p>

    <p>During this exercise you will learn to open a <a target="_blank"
    href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-text-file">text
    file</a> for writing and write text to it, including text in
    languages other than English. You will also learn about the optional
    parameters of the <code>open</code> function.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Write a Python program named <code>text_file.py</code> with three
    functions named <code>write_text_file</code>,
    <code>read_text_file</code>, and <code>main</code> as follows:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div><code>write_text_file</code>
        <ol>
            <li><div>Has two parameters named <var>filename</var> and
            <var>text</var></div></li>
            <li><div>Opens the text file named <var>filename</var> for
            writing with the utf-8 encoding.</div></li>
            <li><div>Writes all the text to the file.</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>

        <li><div><code>read_text_file</code>
        <ol>
            <li><div>Has one parameter named
            <var>filename</var>.</div></li>
            <li><div>Opens a text file for reading with the utf-8
            encoding.</div></li>
            <li><div>Reads all the text in the file into a
            string.</div></li>
            <li><div>Return the string.</div></li>
       </ol></div></li>

        <li><div><code>main</code>
        <ol>
            <li><div>Has no parameters.</div></li>
            <li><div>Calls <code>write_text_file</code> to write the
            following string to a file named "forgive.txt".
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">verse = """For if ye forgive men their trespasses,
your Heavenly Father will also forgive you.
ἐὰν γὰρ ἀφῆτε τοῖς ἀνθρώποις τὰ παραπτώματα αὐτῶν,
ἀφήσει καὶ ὑμῖν ὁ πατὴρ ὑμῶν ὁ οὐράνιος.
𐐙𐐫𐑉, 𐐮𐑁 𐐷 𐑁𐐲𐑉𐑀𐐮𐑂 𐑋𐐯𐑌 𐑄𐐯𐑉 𐐻𐑉𐐯𐑅𐐹𐐰𐑅𐐮𐑆,

            <li><div>Calls <code>read_text_file</code> to read the
            contents of <code>forgive.txt</code>.</div></li>
            <li><div>Prints the text returned from
            <code>read_text_file</code>.</div></li>
        </ol>

        <p>Notice that the string includes characters from English,
        Greek, and the Deseret alphabet. It is important that the test
        string includes characters from other languages besides English
        so that you can verify that your <code>write_text_file</code>
        and <code>read_text_file</code> functions are working
        correctly.</p></div></li>

        <li><div>At the bottom of your program, write a line of code to
        call the <code>main</code> function. Then run your program and
        verify that your program correctly writes and reads the
        <var>verse</var> string from above. All the characters in
        <code>forgive.txt</code> should look the same as they look in
        this web page.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
    <p>Your program must include the following functions, each working
    correctly. Each function must have its own document string (triple
    quoted string) that explains what the function does.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div><code>write_text_file</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>read_text_file</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>main</code></div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an
    hour, complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that
    the stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Add something or change something in your program that
        you think would make your program better, easier for the user,
        more elegant, or more fun. Be creative.</div></li>

        <li><div>Write comments above the lines of code that were
        difficult for you to understand.</div></li>

        <li><div>Add a function named <code>copy_text_file</code> that
        takes two parameters named source_filename and target_filename.
        The function must call <code>read_text_file</code> and then
        <code>write_text_file</code> and thus copy the contents of
        source_filename into target_filename.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="test long">
        <li><div>Run your program and verify that your program correctly
        wrote the multi-language string to the <code>forgive.txt</code>
        file. Open the <code>forgive.txt</code> file in VS Code. All the
        characters in <code>forgive.txt</code> should look the same as
        they look above in this web page.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
    <a download href="teach_solution.py">sample solution</a>. Please
    <strong>do not look at the sample solution</strong> until you have
    either finished the program or diligently worked for at least one
    hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling to
    complete the assignment, you may use the sample solution to help you
    finish.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
