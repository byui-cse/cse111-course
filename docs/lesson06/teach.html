    <h1>06 Team Activity: Writing Text to a File</h1>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Arrange a one hour synchronous meeting with your team for this
    activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing meeting.
    Campus students will use class time for this meeting. You should
    prepare for this meeting by completing the preparation material and
    the individual checkpoint assignment beforehand.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Many programs need to read and write text files. Often that text
    will be in languages other than English. Early electronic computers
    were able to process and store English characters only. In 1987,
    several individuals began investigating the possibility of a
    universal character set that would enable computers to store and
    transmit characters from all human languages. Their work led to the
    international standard known as Unicode. The Unicode standard
    assigns a unique number to every character or almost every character
    written by humans throughout the history of the world.</p>

    <p>During this exercise you will learn to open a <a target="_blank"
    href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-text-file">text
    file</a> for writing and write text to it, including text in
    languages other than English. You will also learn about the optional
    parameters of the <code>open</code> function.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Write a Python program that reads text from a text file, uses the
    <code>requests</code> module to send that text to an online machine
    translation service, and then saves the translated text to another
    text file.</p>

    <p>Do the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Start your program in a blank file and import the
        <code>requests</code> module.</div></li>

        <li><div>Write a function named <code>read_text_file</code> that
        takes one parameter named <var>filename</var>. This function
        must open a text file for reading, read all the text in the
        file, and return that text. When writing the code to open the
        file, be certain to use the named argument <var>mode</var> to
        open the file for reading and use the named argument
        <var>encoding</var> to open the file with the utf-8
        encoding.</div></li>

        <li><div>Write a function named <code>write_text_file</code>
        that takes two parameters named <var>filename</var> and
        <var>text</var>. This function must open a text file for writing
        and write all the text to the file. When writing the code to
        open the file, be certain to use the named argument
        <var>mode</var> to open the file for writing and use the named
        argument <var>encoding</var> to open the file with the utf-8
        encoding.</div></li>

        <li><div><p>Write a function named <code>test_io</code> that
        takes no parameters. This function must call
        <code>write_text_file</code> to write the following string to a
        text file named "forgive.txt". Then <code>test_io</code> must
        call <code>read_text_file</code> to read the contents of
        <code>forgive.txt</code> and then print the text returned from
        <code>read_text_file</code>.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">matt_6_14 = \
    """For if ye forgive men their trespasses,
    your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
    ἐὰν γὰρ ἀφῆτε τοῖς ἀνθρώποις τὰ παραπτώματα αὐτῶν,
    ἀφήσει καὶ ὑμῖν ὁ πατὴρ ὑμῶν ὁ οὐράνιος.
    𐐙𐐫𐑉, 𐐮𐑁 𐐷 𐑁𐐲𐑉𐑀𐐮𐑂 𐑋𐐯𐑌 𐑄𐐯𐑉 𐐻𐑉𐐯𐑅𐐹𐐰𐑅𐐮𐑆,
    𐐷𐐫𐑉 𐐸𐐯𐑂𐐲𐑌𐑊𐐨 𐐙𐐱𐑄𐐲𐑉 𐐶𐐮𐑊 𐐫𐑊𐑅𐐬 𐑁𐐲𐑉𐑀𐐮𐑂 𐐷𐐭.
    """</pre></div>

        <p>Notice that the string includes characters from English,
        Greek, and the Deseret alphabet. It is important that the test
        string includes characters from other languages so that you can
        verify that your <code>write_text_file</code> and
        <code>read_text_file</code> functions are working
        correctly.</p></div></li>

        <li><div>At the bottom of your program, write a line of code to
        call the test_io function. For example:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">test_io()</pre></div>
        Then run your program and verify that your program correctly
        prints the string from above by opening the
        <code>forgive.txt</code> file in VS Code. All the characters in
        <code>forgive.txt</code> should look the same as they look above
        in this web page. After you have verified that your
        <code>write_text_file</code> and <code>read_text_file</code>
        functions are working correctly, delete the call to the
        <code>test_io</code> function.</div></li>

        <li><div>Write a function named <code>translate</code> that has
        three parameters: <var>text</var>, <var>src_lang</var>, and
        <var>targ_lan</var>. This function must use the
        <code>post</code> function in the <code>requests</code> module
        to send the text to the online machine translation service at
        yandex.net and must return the translated text. Look in your
        Canvas course for the API key that you will need in the post
        request.</div></li>

        <li><div>Write the <code>main</code> function to do the
        following for these three files:
        <a download href="sermon_en.txt">sermon_en.txt</a>,
        <a download href="upward_en.txt">upward_en.txt</a>, and
        <a download href="numsys_en.txt">numsys_en.txt</a>
        <ol>
            <li><div>Call <code>read_text_file</code> to read the text
            in the file.</div></li>
            <li><div>Call the <code>translate</code> function to
            translate the text to another language. You choose the
            language.</div></li>
            <li><div>Call <code>write_text_file</code> to write the
            translated text to another file.</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Your program must include the
        <code>read_text_file</code>, <code>write_text_file</code>, and
        <code>test_io</code> functions that work correctly as described
        above.</div></li>

        <li><div>Your program must include the <code>translate</code>
        function that translates text as described above.</div></li>

        <li><div>Your program must include the main function that reads
        three text files, translates them, and writes them to different
        files.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an
    hour, complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that
    the stretch challenges are optional.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Add something or change something in your program that
        you think would make your program better, easier for the user,
        more elegant, or more fun. Be creative.</div></li>

        <li><div>Add a feature to your program that allows the user to
        choose which language the text will be translated into.</div></li>

        <li><div>Write comments above the lines of code that were
        difficult for you to understand.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="testing">
        <li><div>After finishing step 5 above, run your program and
        verify that your program correctly wrote the multi-language
        string to the <code>forgive.txt</code> file. Open the
        <code>forgive.txt</code> file in VS Code. All the characters in
        <code>forgive.txt</code> should look the same as they look above
        in this web page.</div></li>

        <li><div>After finishing all seven steps above, run your program
        and verify that it correctly translates the three text files and
        writes the translated text to three other files.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one-hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
    sample solution. Please <strong>do not look at the sample
    solution</strong> until you have either finished the program or
    diligently worked for at least one hour. At the end of the hour, if
    you are still struggling to complete the assignment, you may use the
    sample solution to help you finish.</p>
