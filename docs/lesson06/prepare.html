    <h1>06 Prepare: Troubleshooting Functions</h1>
    <p>What should you do when your program isn't working? If your
    program is small, you could examine each line of the program.
    However, if your program is large or contains multiple functions,
    there are better ways to find and fix the problems.</p>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn during this lesson.</p>

    <h3>Types of Mistakes</h3>
    <p>Broadly speaking, there are two types of mistakes or errors that
    a programmer might make when writing a program: syntax errors and
    logic errors. A <dfn>syntax error</dfn> is a mistake made by a
    programmer that violates the rules of a programming language such as
    misspelling a keyword, forgetting to type a closing parenthesis, or
    forgetting to type a colon (:) at the end of an <code>if</code>
    statement. A syntax error will cause the computer to terminate a
    Python program and print an error message to the terminal. A
    <dfn>logic error</dfn> is a mistake made by a programmer that causes
    the computer to produce the wrong results. Often, a logic error will
    not cause the computer to terminate a program or to print an error
    message. It will simply cause the computer to produce incorrect
    results.</p>

    <h3>Error Messages</h3>
    <p>Regardless of the type of error (syntax or logic), if the
    computer prints an error message while executing a program, the
    first thing a programmer should do is read and understand the error
    message. Example&nbsp;1 shows a simple Python program that contains
    a syntax error. The message that the computer printed because of the
    syntax error is shown below example&nbsp;1.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex1"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 1

def main():
    print("Are you surprised, Clark?)

# Start this program by
# calling the main function.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console">&gt; python surprise.py
  File "C:\Users\cse111\lesson06\surprise.py", <em>line 4</em>
    print("Are you surprised, Clark?)
                                    ^
<em>SyntaxError</em>: EOL while scanning string literal
</pre>

    <p>From the error message, we read that example&nbsp;1 contains a
    syntax error and that the error is on line&nbsp;4 of the program
    where there is something wrong with the string. By examining the
    error message and the program at line&nbsp;4, we learn that the
    programmer forgot to type the closing double quote at the end of the
    string. By the way, <dfn>EOL</dfn> that appears in the error message
    is an acronym for "end of line." You might also see the acronyms
    <dfn>EOF</dfn> and <dfn>EOT</dfn> which mean "end of file" and "end
    of transmission."</p>

    <p>If the computer prints an error message that you don't
    understand, you can search the internet for its meaning. Simply copy
    and paste the error message into the search bar of your browser.
    Here are two of the search results from Google for the error message
    "SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal."</p>

<div class="search">About 27,500 results (0.49 seconds)

<a href="https://discover.cs.ucsb.edu/commonerrors/error/1010.xml">SyntaxError- EOL while scanning string literal</a>
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal "EOL" stands for "end of line". An EOL error means that Python hit the end of a line while going through a string.

<a href="https://www.askpython.com/python/syntax-error-eol-while-scanning-string-literal">Syntax Error: EOL while scanning string literal - AskPython</a>
EOL stands for “End of Line”. The error means that the Python Interpreter reached the end of the line when it tried to scan the string literal. The string literals (constants) must be enclosed in single and double quotation marks.</div>

    <h3>Print Statements</h3>
    <p>If the computer doesn't print an error message, but your program
    is producing incorrect results, you could add print statements to
    your code in strategic locations to help you find the mistakes.
    These print statements should print the value of the variables in
    your program so that you can examine the values to ensure they are
    correct. Example&nbsp;2 contains a program with a complex
    calculation for computing the remaining balance of a loan. Notice
    the print statements at
    lines&nbsp;<span class="cross" data-ref="ex2">28, 32, and&nbsp;35</span>
    and also at
    lines&nbsp;<span class="cross" data-ref="ex2">43, 47, and&nbsp;50</span>.
    The programmer wrote these print statements at important points in
    the program, specifically near the beginning of each function and in
    the middle of the calculations.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex2"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 2

def main():
    print("This program computes and prints the remaining")
    print("balance for a loan with a fixed annual percentage")
    print("rate and a fixed number of payments per year.")
    print()
    print("Please enter the following five values.")

    principal = float(input("Principal amount: "))
    annual_rate = float(input("Annual percentage rate: "))
    years = int(input("Number of years in the life of the loan: "))
    payments_per_year = int(input("Number of payments per year: "))
    number_paid = int(input("Number of payments already paid: "))

    balance = compute_balance(principal, annual_rate, years,
            payments_per_year, number_paid)

    print()
    print(f"Balance remaining: {balance}")


def compute_balance(princ, ar, years, ppy, ptd):
    """Compute and return the balance remaining for a loan."""
    payment = compute_payment(princ, ar, years, ppy)

    <em>print()</em>
    <em>print(f"compute_balance({princ}, {ar}, {years}, {ppy}, {ptd})")</em>

    rate = ar / ppy
    power = (1 + rate) ** ptd
    <em>print(f"    payment: {payment}  rate: {rate}  power: {power}")</em>

    balance = princ * power - payment * (power - 1) / rate
    <em>print(f"    balance: {balance:.2f}")</em>

    return round(balance, 2)


def compute_payment(princ, ar, years, ppy):
    """Compute and return the payment per period for a loan."""
    <em>print()</em>
    <em>print(f"compute_payment({princ}, {ar}, {years}, {ppy})")</em>

    rate = ar / ppy
    n = years * ppy
    <em>print(f"    rate: {rate}  n: {n}")</em>

    payment = princ * rate / (1 - (1 + rate) ** -n)
    <em>print(f"    payment: {payment:.2f}")</em>

    return round(payment, 2)


# Start this program by
# calling the main function.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="ex2">&gt; python balance.py

    <p>Although print statements are simple to understand and
    add to a program, in many situations they are not the most effective
    way to find logic errors.</p>

    <h3>Test Functions</h3>
    <p>Many programmers underestimate the effectiveness of writing and
    running test functions to find logic errors in a program. Many
    programmers will write a complete program with multiple functions
    and never pause to test any part of it. Instead, they will write the
    entire program and then do something similar to the following steps
    to test it.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Run the program and enter input like a user
        would.</div></li>
        <li><div>Examine the program's output to verify that it is
        correct and find that the output is incorrect.</div></li>
        <li><div>Review all the program's code, make some small changes,
        and add print statements.</div></li>
        <li><div>Repeat steps 1&ndash;3 again and again and again,
        spending lots of time trying to find and fix the
        errors.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>This method for finding and fixing mistakes is time consuming
    because the programmer is trying to test the whole program at once.
    Instead, the programmer should test each individual function by
    writing and running test functions as explained in the
    <a href="../lesson05/prepare.html">previous lesson</a>.</p>

    <h3>Using a Debugger</h3>
    <p>A <dfn>debugger</dfn> is a software development tool that allows
    a programmer to watch the computer execute the code in a program.
    While using a debugger, a programmer can examine the values stored
    in a program's variables as the computer executes each line of the
    program. A debugger is a very effective tool for finding mistakes in
    a program. Nearly all programming languages and environments include
    a debugger. Professional software developers use a debugger nearly
    every single work day. Most companies will not use a programming
    language unless that language includes a debugger.</p>

    <p>The Python programming language includes a debugger that you can
    use while writing a program in VS Code. It is much easier to learn
    how to use a debugger by watching someone use it than by reading
    about a debugger. Watch the following video that shows a BYU-Idaho
    faculty member using a debugger in VS Code to find mistakes in a
    program.</p>

    <ul class="videos">
        <li><div><p>How to Use the <a href="https://content.byui.edu/items/a9e60503-b5e7-40f0-bf48-ebf1a7441d25/1/debug_mpg.mp4">Python Debugger in VS Code</a> <span class="duration">(18 minutes)</span></p>
        <iframe class="video" style="min-width:820px; min-height:640px;" allowfullscreen src="https://content.byui.edu/items/a9e60503-b5e7-40f0-bf48-ebf1a7441d25/1/debug_mpg.mp4"></iframe>
        </div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>A debugger is also a great learning tool. Using a debugger to
    step through the statements of your program one at a time and
    examining the values of the variables after each step will show you
    exactly how Python works. Try it! If you don't completely understand
    <code>if</code>-<code>elif</code>-<code>else</code> statements,
    <code>while</code> loops, <code>for</code> loops, passing
    parameters, or returning a value from a function, then start a
    program that contains those elements in the debugger and step
    through it one line at a time. After the computer executes each
    statement, examine the values of the variables and predict in your
    mind how the next statement will change the values of the
    variables.</p>
