	<h1>06 Prepare: Function Details</h1>
	<p>During this lesson, you will learn additional details about
	writing and calling functions. These details will help you
	understand functions better and use them more effectively. These
	details include variable scope, optional parameters, named
	arguments, and how arguments are passed to functions.</p>

	<h2>Variable Scope</h2>
	<p>The <dfn>scope</dfn> of a variable determines how long that
	variable exists and where it can be used. Within a Python program,
	there are two categories of scope:  local and global. A variable has
	<dfn>local scope</dfn> when it is defined (assigned a value) inside
	a function. A variable has <dfn>global scope</dfn> when it is
	defined outside of all functions. Here is a small Python program
	that has two variables: <var>g</var> and <var>x</var>. <var>g</var>
	is defined outside of all functions and therefore has global scope.
	<var>x</var> is defined inside the function <code>main</code> and
	therefore has local scope.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums">1

<pre class="python"># g is global because it is
# defined outside of all functions.
g = 25

def main():
    # x is local because it is
    # defined inside a function.
    x = 1</pre></div>

	<p>As shown in the following table, a local variable (a variable
	with local scope) is defined inside a function, exists for as long
	as its containing function is executing, and can be used within its
	containing function but nowhere else. Parameters have local scope
	scope because they are defined within a function, specifically
	within a functionâ€™s header and exist for as long as their containing
	function is executing. A global variable (a variable with global
	scope) is defined outside of all functions, exists for as long as
	its containing Python program is executing and can be used within
	all functions in its containing Python program.</p>

	<table><thead>
		<tr><th colspan="3">Python Variable Scope</th></tr>
		<tr><th></th> <th>Local</th> <th>Global</th></tr>
	</thead><tbody>
		<tr><th>Where to Define</th>
			<td>Inside a function</td>
			<td>Outside of all functions</td></tr>
		<tr><th>Owner</th>
			<td>The function where the variable is defined</td>
			<td>The Python file where the variable is defined</td></tr>
		<tr><th>Lifetime</th>
			<td>Only as long as its containing function is
			executing</td>
			<td>As long as its containing program is executing</td></tr>
		<tr><th>Where<br>Usable</th>
			<td>Only inside the function where it is defined</td>

	</tbody></table>

	<p>The following Python code example contains variables with local,
	and global scope. The variable <var>nShapes</var> is global because
	it is defined outside of all functions. Because it is a global
	variable, the code in the body of all functions may use the variable
	<var>nShapes</var>. Within the function <code>sqare_area</code>, the
	parameter named <var>length</var> and the variable named
	<var>area</var> both have local scope. Within the function
	<code>rectangle_area</code>, the parameters named <var>width</var>
	and <var>length</var> have local scope and the variable named
	<var>area</var> has local scope.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums">1

<pre class="python">nShapes = 0

def sqare_area(length):
	area = length * length
	return area

def rectangle_area(width, length):
	area = width * length
	return area</pre></div>

	<p>Because local variables are visible only within the function
	where they are defined, a programmer can define two variables with
	the same name as long as he defines them in different functions. In
	the previous example, both of the functions <code>square_area</code>
	and <code>rectangle_area</code> contain a parameter named
	<var>length</var> and a variable named <var>area</var>. All four of
	these variables are entirely separate and do not conflict with each
	other in any way because the scope of each variable is local to the
	function where it is defined.</p>

	<p>A common mistake that many programmers make is to assume that a
	local variable can be used inside of other functions. For example,
	the following Python code includes two functions named
	<code>main</code> and <code>circle_area</code>. Some programmers
	assume that the variable <var>radius</var> that is defined in
	<code>main</code> (and is therefore local to <code>main</code> only)
	can be used in <code>circle_area</code>.</p>

<pre class="python">import math

def main():
	radius = input("Enter the radius of a circle: )
	area = circle_area()
	print(area)

def circle_area():
	# Mistake! There is no variable named radius
	# inside this function, so the variable
	# radius cannot be used in this function.
	area = math.pi * radius * radius
	return area

main()</pre></div>

	<h2>Default Parameter Values and Optional Arguments</h2>
	<p>Python allows function parameters to have default values. If a
	parameter has a default value, then its corresponding argument is
	optional. If a function is called without an argument, the
	corresponding parameter gets its default value. Consider this
	example Python code:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums">1
2
3

7

11

13</pre>
<pre class="python">import math

def main():
    <em>length = arc_length(25)</em>
    print(length)

def arc_length(degrees, <em>radius=1</em>):
    """Compute and return the arc length of a circle."""
    circum = 2 * math.pi * radius
    len = circum * degrees / 360
    return len

main()</pre></div>

	<p>Notice at line 7 in the header for the <code>arc_length</code>
	function, that the parameter degrees does not have a default value
	but the parameter <var>radius</var> has a default value of 1. This
	means that when a programmer calls the <code>arc_length</code>
	function, the programmer must pass a value for degrees but is not
	required to pass a value for radius. At line 4, the programmer
	called the <code>arc_length</code> function and passed 25 for the
	<var>degrees</var> parameter but did not pass a value for the
	<var>radius</var>, so during that call to <code>arc_length</code>,
	the value of <var>radius</var> will be the default value from line 7
	which is 1.</p>

	<h2>Named Arguments</h2>
	<p></p>

	<h2>Variable Values and References</h2>
	<p>In Python, variables are processed differently based on their
	data type. For example, here is a small Python program that contains
	two integer variables named <var>x</var> and <var>y</var>.</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums">1
2
3
4
5
6

8</pre>
<pre class="code">def main():
    x = 3
    y = x
    print(f"x: {x}  y: {y}")
    y += 1
    print(f"x: {x}  y: {y}")

main()</pre></div>

	<p>The previous code will print this:</p>
<pre class="console">&gt; python prep1.py
x: 3  y: 3
x: 3  y: 4</pre>

	<p>Within the previous code,</p>
	<ul>
		<li><div>the statement on line 2 stores the value 3 into
		the variable <var>x</var>.</div></li>
		<li><div>Line 3 copies the value that is in the variable
		<var>x</var> into the variable <var>y</var>.</div></li>
		<li><div>Line 4 prints the values of <var>x</var> and
		<var>y</var> which are both 3.</div></li>
		<li><div>Line 5 adds one to the value of <var>y</var>, making
		its value 4 instead of 3.</div></li>
		<li><div>Line 6 prints the values of <var>x</var> and
		<var>y</var>. The value of <var>x</var> remained unchanged. The
		value of <var>y</var> was changed to 4.</div></li>
	</ul>

	<p>Why did line 5 (<code>y += 1</code>) change the value of
	<var>y</var> but not change the value of <var>x</var>? Because line
	3 copied the value that was in <var>x</var> into <var>y</var>.</p>

	<p>Here is a small Python program that contains two variables named
	<var>lx</var> and <var>ly</var> that each refer to a list. This
	program is similar to the first program, but it processes lists
	instead of integers.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums">1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8</pre>
<pre class="code">def main():
    lx = [7, -2]
    ly = lx
    print(f"lx: {lx}  y: {ly}")
    ly.append(5)
    print(f"lx: {lx}  y: {ly}")

main()</pre></div>

	<p>Here is the output of the second program.</p>

<pre class="console">&gt; python prep2.py
lx: [7, -2]  y: [7, -2]
lx: [7, -2, 5]  y: [7, -2, 5]</pre>

	<p>From the output of this second program, we can see there is a big
	difference between the way a Python program assigns integers and the
	way it assigns lists. Within the second program,</p>
	<ul>
		<li><div>the statement on line 2 creates a list and stores a
		reference to that list in the variable <var>lx</var>.</div></li>
		<li><div>Line 3 copies the reference in the variable
		<var>lx</var> into the variable <var>ly</var>. Line 3 does not
		create a copy of the list but instead causes both the variables
		<var>lx</var> and <var>ly</var> to refer to the same
		list.</div></li>
		<li><div>Line 4 prints the values of <var>lx</var> and
		<var>ly</var>. Notice that their values are the same as we
		expect them to be because of line 3.</div></li>
		<li><div>Line 5 appends the number 5 onto the list
		<var>ly</var>.</div></li>
		<li><div>Line 6 prints the values of <var>lx</var> and
		<var>ly</var> again. Notice in the output that when
		<var>lx</var> and <var>ly</var> are printed the second time, it
		appears that the number 5 was appended to both lists.</div></li>
	</ul>

	<p>Why does it appear that appending the number 5 onto <var>ly</var>
	also appended the number 5 onto <var>lx</var>? What really happened
	is that <var>lx</var> and <var>ly</var> refer to the same list.
	There is really only one list with two references to that list.
	Because <var>lx</var> and <var>ly</var> refer to the same list, a
	change to the list through variable <var>ly</var> can be seen
	through variable <var>lx</var>.</p>

	<p>When a computer executes a Python statement to assign the value
	of a boolean, integer, or float variable to another variable
	(<code>y = x</code>), the computer copies <em>the value</em> of one
	variable into the other. However, when a computer executes a Python
	statement to assign the value of a string, list, set, or dictionary
	variable to another variable (<code>ly = lx</code>), the computer
	does not copy the value but instead copies <em>the reference</em> so
	that both variables refer to the same value in memory.</p>

	<p>The fact that the computer copies the value of some data types
	(boolean, integer, float) and copies the reference for other data
	types (list, set, dict) has important implications for passing
	arguments into functions. Consider this Python program with two
	functions named <code>modify_args</code> and <code>main</code>.</p>

    # Change the values of both parameters.
    n += 1
    ls.append(5)

    print(f"   n: {n}  ls: {ls}")


def main():
    print("main()")
    x = 3
    lx = [7, -2]
    print(f"x: {x}  lx: {lx}")

    # Pass one integer and one list
    # to the modify_args function.
    modify_args(x, lx)

    print(f"x: {x}  lx: {lx}")


# Call main to begin this program.
main()</pre></div>

	<p>Within this third program,</p>
	<ul>
		<li><div>the statement on line 17 assigns the value 3 to a
		variable named <var>x</var>.</div></li>
		<li><div>Line 18 assigns a list to a variable named
		<var>lx</var>.</div></li>
		<li><div>Line 19 prints the values of <var>x</var> and
		<var>lx</var> before they are passed to the
		<var>modify_args</var> function.</div></li>
		<li><div>Line 23 calls the <code>modify_args</code> function and
		passes <var>x</var> and <var>lx</var> to that function.</div></li>
		<li><div>Within the <code>modify_args</code> function, line 7
		changes the value of the parameter <var>n</var> by adding one to
		it.</div></li>
		<li><div>Line 25 prints the values of <var>x</var> and
		<var>lx</var> after they were passed to the
		<code>modify_args</code> function. Notice in the output below
		that the value of <var>x</var> was not changed by the
		<code>modify_args</code> function. However, the value of
		<var>lx</var> was changed by the <code>modify_args</code>
		function.</div></li>
		<li><div></div></li>
	</ul>

<pre class="console">&gt; python prep3.py
main()
x: 3  lx: [7, -2]
    modify_args()
    n: 3  ls: [7, -2]
    n: 4  ls: [7, -2, 5]
x: 3  lx: [7, -2, 5]</pre>

	<p>From the output of the third program, we can see that modifying
	an integer parameter changes the integer within the called function
	only. However modifying a list parameter changes the list within the
	called function and the calling function. Why? Because when a
	computer passes a boolean, integer, or float variable to a function,
	the computer copies <em>the value</em> of that variable into the
	parameter of the called function. However, when a computer passes a
	list, set, or dictionary variable to a function, the computer copies
	<em>the reference</em> so that the original variable and the
	parameter both refer to the same value in memory.</p>
