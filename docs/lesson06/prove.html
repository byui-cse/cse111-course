    <h1>06 Prove Assignment: Troubleshooting Functions</h1>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a Python program and write and run test
    functions to help you find and fix mistakes.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>The <dfn>Turing test</dfn>, named after Alan Turing, is a test of a
    computer's ability to make conversation that is indistinguishable
    from human conversation. A computer that could pass the Turing test
    would need to understand sentences typed by a human and respond with
    sentences that make sense.</p>

    <p>In English, a <dfn>preposition</dfn> is a word used to express
    spatial or temporal relations, such as "in", "over", and "before". A
    <dfn>prepositional phrase</dfn> is group of words that begins with a
    preposition and includes a noun. For example:</p>

    <blockquote>above the water<br>
    in the kitchen<br>
    after the meeting</blockquote>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Write the second half of the Python program that you began in the
    previous lesson's <a href="../lesson05/prove.html">prove milestone</a>,
    a program that generates simple English sentences. During this
    lesson, you will write and test functions that generate sentences
    with four parts:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>a determiner</div></li>
        <li><div>a noun</div></li>
        <li><div>a verb</div></li>
        <li><div>a prepositional phrase </div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>For example:</p>
    <blockquote>One girl talked for the car.<br>
    Some dogs drank above many adults.<br>
    One bird drinks off one child.<br>
    Some children laugh at many dogs.<br>
    The child will run on the car.<br>
    Some adults will talk about some cats.</blockquote>

    <p>After this lesson, your program must include at least these
    six functions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div><code>main</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>get_determiner</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>get_noun</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>get_verb</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>get_prepositional_phrase</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>get_preposition</code></div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>You may add other functions if you want. The
    <code>get_preposition</code> function must randomly choose a
    preposition from a list and return the randomly chosen preposition.
    The <code>get_prepositional_phrase</code> function must make a
    prepositional phrase by calling the <code>get_preposition</code>,
    <code>get_determiner</code>, and <code>get_noun</code> functions.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <p>The <a href="prepare.html">prepare content</a> for this lesson
    explains how to troubleshoot functions and entire programs that are not
    working correctly.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Do the following:</p>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Use the <code>get_determiner</code> function from the
        previous lesson as an example to help you write the
        <code>get_preposition</code> function. The
        <code>get_preposition</code> function must have the following
        header and fulfill the requirements of the following
        documentation string.

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
def get_preposition():
    """Return a randomly chosen preposition
    from this list of prepositions:
        "about", "above", "across", "after", "along",
        "around", "at", "before", "behind", "below",
        "beyond", "by", "despite", "except", "for",
        "from", "in", "into", "near", "of",
        "off", "on", "onto", "out", "over",
        "past", "to", "under", "with", "without"

    Return: a randomly chosen preposition.
    """</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Write the <code>get_prepositional_phrase</code>
        function to have the following header and fulfill the
        requirements of the following documentation string.

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
def get_prepositional_phrase(quantity):
    """Build and return a prepositional phrase composed of three
    words: a preposition, a determiner, and a noun by calling the
    get_preposition, get_determiner, and get_noun functions.

    Parameter
        quantity: an integer that determines if the
            determiner and nouns are singular or plural.
    Return: a prepositional phrase.
    """</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div><p>Add code to the <code>main</code> function and write
        any other functions that you think are necessary for your
        program to generate and print six more sentences with the
        following characteristics. Each of these six additional
        functions must include a prepositional phrase.</p>

        <table><thead>
            <tr><th></th> <th>Grammatical Number</th> <th>Verb Tense</th></tr>
        </thead><tbody>
            <tr><td>a.</td> <td>singular</td> <td>past</td></tr>
            <tr><td>b.</td> <td>plural</td> <td>past</td></tr>
            <tr><td>c.</td> <td>singular</td> <td>present</td></tr>
            <tr><td>d.</td> <td>plural</td> <td>present</td></tr>
            <tr><td>e.</td> <td>singular</td> <td>future</td></tr>
            <tr><td>f.</td> <td>plural</td> <td>future</td></tr>
        </tbody></table>
        </div></li>

        <li><div><p>In the <code>test_sentences.py</code> file write two
        functions named <code>test_get_preposition</code> and
        <code>test_get_prepositional_phrase</code> that test the
        <code>get_preposition</code> and
        <code>get_prepositional_phrase</code> functions.</p>

        <p>Perhaps you are wondering what code you should write in the
        <code>test_get_prepositional_phrase</code> function. To answer
        that question, ask yourself, "What do we know about the
        <code>get_prepositional_phrase</code> function?" From its
        description, we know the <code>get_prepositional_phrase</code>
        function returns a phrase made of three words: a preposition, a
        determiner, and a noun. So you could write code in the
        <code>test_get_prepositional_phrase</code> function that calls
        the <code>get_prepositional_phrase</code> function and then
        asserts that the string returned from
        <code>get_prepositional_phrase</code> contains three words
        separated by spaces. In addition, you could write code that
        calls the Python string
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split"><code>split</code> method</a>
        to split the returned phrase into its three words and checks
        each of the three words.</p>
        </div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your test program works correctly by following each
    step in this procedure:</p>

    <ol class="test">
        <li><div>Run your <code>test_sentences.py</code> program and
        verify that all five of the test functions pass. If one or more
        of the tests don't pass, find and fix the mistakes in your
        program functions or test functions until the tests pass as
        shown in this output:

        </div></li>

        <li><div>Run your sentences.py program and ensure that your
        program's output is similar to the sample run output shown here.
        Because your program will randomly choose the determiners,
        nouns, verbs, and prepositions, your program will generate
        different sentences than the ones shown here.

<pre class="console">&gt; python sentences.py

One girl talked for the car.

Some children laugh at many dogs.

    <h2>Ponder</h2>
    <p>How hard would it be to modify your program to pass the Turing
    test?</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>To submit your program, return to I-Learn and do these two
    things:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Upload your <code>sentences.py</code> and
        <code>test_sentences.py</code> files for feedback.</div></li>

        <li><div>Add a submission comment that specifies the grading
        category that best describes your program along with a one or
        two sentence justification for your choice. The grading criteria
        are:
        <ul>
            <li><div>1. Some attempt made</div></li>
            <li><div>2. Developing but significantly deficient</div></li>
            <li><div>3. Slightly deficient</div></li>
            <li><div>4. Meets requirements</div></li>
            <li><div>5. Exceeds requirements</div></li>
