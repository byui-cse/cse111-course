    <h1>06 Prove Assignment: Writing Functions</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write and call functions by writing a program
    that draws an outdoor scene in a window.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Most modern computer operating systems have graphical user
    interfaces (GUIs) that are rich with colors, icons, images, menus,
    tabs, buttons, text fields, sliders, scroll bars, etc. However, many
    Python programs are designed to run in a console window, also called
    a terminal window, to read user input from a keyboard, and to print
    text as output to the console window. This means that many Python
    programs are not designed and written to take advantage of the rich
    features of graphical user interfaces.</p>

    <p>Python includes two competing libraries of code named
    <code>tkinter</code> and <code>kivy</code> that enable a program to
    have a user interface. Writing a program with a complete GUI is a
    large task. During the previous lesson, you wrote code to draw at
    least the sky, clouds, and the ground. During this lesson, you will
    write code to finish drawing an outdoor scene.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>During this lesson, you will write code that draws the remaining
    elements in your scene. The scene that your program draws must be
    outdoor, the sky must have clouds, and the scene must include
    repetitive elements such as blades of grass, trees, leaves on a
    tree, birds, flowers, insects, fish, pickets in a fence, dashed
    lines on a road, buildings, bales of hay, snowmen, snowflakes, or
    icicles. Be creative.</p>

    <p>Each repetitive element must be drawn by a function that your
    program calls repeatedly, once for each repeated element. For
    example, your program may include a function named
    <code>draw_leaf</code> that your program repeatedly calls to draw
    all the leaves on a tree.</p>

    <p>As you write your program, be sure that it draws elements in the
    order of farthest to nearest. For example, your program should draw
    the sky first, then clouds, then the ground, then trees, and then
    insects in the trees.</p>

    <h2>Scene Gallery</h2>
    <p>All the scenes in
    <a target="_blank" href="../lesson06/gallery/index.html">this gallery</a>
    were drawn by programs written by former CSE 111 students.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Videos</h2>
    <p>The following videos walk through two examples of using functions
    to draw with <code>tkinter</code>.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="test">
        <li><div>Run your program and verify that it correctly opens a
        window and draws within that window a complete outdoor scene
        that contains the sky, clouds, the ground, and other
        elements.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>To submit your program, return to I-Learn and do these two
    things:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Upload your program (the .py file) for feedback.</div></li>
        <li><div>Add a submission comment that specifies the grading
        category that best describes your program along with a one or
        two sentence justification for your choice. The grading criteria
        are:
        <ul>
            <li><div>1. Some attempt made</div></li>
            <li><div>2. Developing but significantly deficient</div></li>
            <li><div>3. Slightly deficient</div></li>
            <li><div>4. Meets requirements</div></li>
            <li><div>5. Exceeds requirements</div></li>
        </ul></div></li>
    </ol>
