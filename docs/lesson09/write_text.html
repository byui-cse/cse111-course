    <h1>Writing Text Files</h1>

    <h2 id="text_files">Text Files</h2>
    <p>Broadly speaking, there are two types of files: text files and
    binary files. A <dfn>text file</dfn> stores words and numbers as
    human readable text. A <dfn>binary file</dfn> stores pictures,
    diagrams, sounds, music, movies, and other media as numbers in a
    format that is not directly readable by humans.</p>

    <h3 id="write">Writing into a Text File</h3>
    <p>In order to write text to a file, a program must call the
    built-in <code>open</code> function to open the file for writing or
    appending text and then call the <code>.write</code> method or the
    built-in <code>print</code> function. Example&nbsp;1 contains a
    program that asks the user for an inspirational quote and then
    appends that quote to a text file. At
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;8</span>, the program
    calls the built-in open <code>function</code>, and at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;11</span>, the program
    calls the built-in <code>print</code> function.</p>

<div class="example" id="ex1"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 1

def main():
    # Ask the user to enter a quote.
    quote = input("Please enter an inspirational quote: ")

    # Open the quotes.txt file for appending text.
    with open("quotes.txt", "at") as quotes_file:

        # Print the quote to the text file.
        print(quote, <em>file=quotes_file</em>)


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre>
</div>

    <p>Example&nbsp;2 shows how to write the contents of a list into a
    text file. At <span class="cross" data-ref="ex2">line&nbsp;21</span>,
    the program calls the built-in <code>open</code> function to open a
    text file for writing. At
    lines&nbsp;<span class="cross" data-ref="ex2">25&ndash;26</span>,
    the program uses a <code>for</code> loop to print each element of a
    list on a separate line.</p>

<div class="example" id="ex2"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 2

def main():
    # Create a list that contains types of small boats.
    boat_list = ["canoe", "kayak", "skiff", "dinghy"]

    # Write the list to a file named small_boats.txt
    write_list("small_boats.txt", boat_list)


def write_list(filename, text_list):
    """Write the contents of a list into a text file.

    Parameters
        filename: the name of the text file to write
        text_list: the list to write to the text file
    Return: nothing
    """
    # Open the text file for writing and store a reference
    # to the opened file in a variable named text_file.
    with open(filename, "wt") as text_file:

        # Print the contents of the list into
        # the text file, one line at a time.
        for element in text_list:
            print(element, file=text_file)


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre>
</div>

    <h2 id="csv_files">CSV Files</h2>
    <p>Many computer systems import and export data in CSV files. CSV is
    an acronym for comma separated values. A <dfn>CSV file</dfn> is a
    text file that contains tabular data with each row on a separate
    line of the file and each cell (column) separated by a comma. The
    following example shows the contents of a CSV file named
    <a download href="hymns.csv"><code>hymns.csv</code></a> that stores
    data about religious songs. Notice that the first row of the file
    contains column headings, the next four rows contain data about four
    hymns, and each row contains three columns separated by commas.</p>

<div class="example"><pre class="csv">
Title,Author,Composer
O Holy Night,John Dwight,Adolphe Adam
"Oh, Come, All Ye Faithful",John Wade,John Wade
Joy to the World,Isaac Watts,George Handel
With Wondering Awe,Anonymous,Anonymous
</pre></div>

    <p>Python has a standard
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html">module named <code>csv</code></a>
    that includes functionality to read from and write to CSV files.

    <h3 id="list_to_csv">Writing a Compound List into a CSV File</h3>
    <p>Example&nbsp;3 shows how to write the contents of a compound list
    into a CSV file. At
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex3">line&nbsp;35</span>, the program
    calls the built-in <code>open</code> function to open a text file
    for writing. At
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex3">line&nbsp;39</span>, the program
    uses the <code>csv</code> module to create a <code>csv.writer</code>
    object. At
    lines&nbsp;<span class="cross" data-ref="ex3">47&ndash;48</span>,
    the program uses a <code>for</code> loop and the
    <code>csv.writer</code> object to write each row to the CSV
    file.</p>

    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>A text file stores words and numbers as human readable text.
    To write text into file, your program must first open the file by
    calling the built-in <code>open</code> function. You should write
    the code to open a file in a Python <code>with</code> block because
    the computer will automatically close the file when the
    <code>with</code> block ends, and you won’t need to remember to
    write code to close the file. To write text to an open text file,
    your program can call the built-in <code>print</code> function with
    the <code>file</code> named argument.</p>

    <p>A CSV file is a text file that contains rows and columns of data.
    CSV is an acronym that stands for comma separated values. Within
    each row in a CSV file, the data values are separated by commas.
    Python includes a standard module named <code>csv</code> that helps
    us easily write Python code to write to a CSV file.</p>
