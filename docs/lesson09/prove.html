    <h1>09 Prove Milestone: Text Files</h1>

    <section>
    <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a Python program that reads CSV files
    and creates, populates, and uses a dictionary.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2 id="problem">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>A local grocery store subscribes to an online service that
    enables its customers to order groceries online. After a customer
    completes an order, the online service sends a CSV file that
    contains the customer’s requests to the grocery store. The store
    needs you to write a program that reads the CSV file and prints a
    receipt in the terminal window that lists the purchased items and
    shows the subtotal, the sales tax amount, and the total.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2 id="assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>During this milestone, you will write half of a Python program
    named <code>receipt.py</code> that prints a receipt in the terminal
    window for a customer’s grocery order. Specifically, by the end of
    this milestone, your program must read and process these two CSV
    files:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>The <code>products.csv</code> file is a catalog of
            all the products that the grocery store sells.</div></li>
        <li><div>The <code>request.csv</code> file contains the items
            ordered by a customer.</div></li>
    </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2 id="help">Help</h2>
    <p>If you’re having trouble completing this assignment, reading
    related online documentation, using a generative AI as a tutor, or
    working with a human tutor will help you complete it.</p>

    <p>You could use a generative AI as a tutor to help you write and
    troubleshoot your program. Bro. Lee Barney created a custom Chat GPT
    named Pythonista that is designed to focus on Python functions,
    loops, if statements, and related programming concepts. If your
    program is generating an error, ask
    <a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-sQydCh2Q6-pythonista">Pythonista</a>
    a question like this:</p>

    <blockquote><p>I'm writing a Python program that generates a sales
    receipt for a retail grocery store. When I run my program, it causes
    the following error. Please suggest some mistakes that might cause
    this error.</p>
    <p><b>(Copy and paste the error message here.)</b></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>You could also ask
    <a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-sQydCh2Q6-pythonista">Pythonista</a>
    a question about one of your functions, like this:</p>

    <blockquote><p>I wrote the following Python function that is
    supposed to <b>(type a short description here)</b>. However, the
    function isn't <b>(type what it's not doing correctly here)</b>.
    Please help me fix this function.</p>

    <h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
    <p>Do the following:</p>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Download both of these files:
        <a download href="products.csv"><code>products.csv</code></a> and
        <a download href="request.csv"><code>request.csv</code></a> and
        save them in the same folder where you will save your Python
        program.</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the <code>products.csv</code> file in VS Code and
        examine it. Notice that each row in this file contains three
        values separated by commas: a product number, a product name,
        and a retail price. Also, notice that each product number in the
        <code>products.csv</code> file is unique. This means that your
        program can read the <code>products.csv</code> file into a
        dictionary and use the product numbers as dictionary
        keys.</div></li>

        <li><div>In VS Code, create a new file and save it as
        <code>receipt.py</code> in the same folder where you saved the
        <code>products.csv</code> and <code>request.csv</code>
        files.</div></li>

        <li><div>In <code>receipt.py</code>, write code to open the
        <code>products.csv</code> file and read its rows into a compound
        dictionary. Because you want to write a well-organized program,
        does it seem like a good idea to put this code into a function?
        Will this function need any parameters? As part of the
        <a href="teach.html">team activity for this lesson</a>, you
        already wrote a similar function.</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the <code>request.csv</code> file in VS Code and
        examine it. Notice that each row contains only two values, a
        product number and a quantity. Notice also that product number
        D083 appears twice in the file because the customer who created
        the order in the <code>request.csv</code> file added four
        yogurts to his order and then later added three more yogurts to
        his order. Because product numbers may appear multiple times in
        the <code>request.csv</code> file, your program should not read
        the contents of <code>request.csv</code> into a
        dictionary.</div></li>

        <li><div><p>In your <code>receipt.py</code> program, write code
        to open the <code>request.csv</code> file and read and process
        each row. Because you want to write a well-organized program,
        does it seem like a good idea to put this code into a function?
        Will this function need any parameters? Your code that reads the
        <code>request.csv</code> file must do the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><div>Open the <code>request.csv</code> file for
            reading.</div></li>

            <li><div>Skip the first line of the <code>request.csv</code>
            file because the first line contains column
            headings.</div></li>

            <li><div>Use a loop that reads and processes each row from
            the <code>request.csv</code> file. Within the body of the
            loop, your program must do the following for each row:
            <ol>
                <li><div>Use the requested product number to find the
                corresponding item in the <var>products_dict</var>.</div></li>
                <li><div>Print the product name, requested quantity, and
                product price.</div></li>
            </ol></div></li>
        </ol></div></li>

        <li><div>In your <code>receipt.py</code> program, write another
        function named <code>main</code> that does the following:
        <ol>
            <li><div>Calls your function that reads from the
            <code>products.csv</code> file into a compound dictionary
            and stores the returned compound dictionary in a variable
            named <var>products_dict</var>. Does your function have any
            parameters? If so, did you add arguments to the function
            call?</div></li>

            <li><div>Prints the <var>products_dict</var>.</div></li>

            <li><div>Calls your function that reads and processes the
            <code>request.csv</code> file. Does your function have any
            parameters? If so, did you add arguments to the function
            call?</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>

        <li><div>At the bottom of your <code>receipt.py</code> file,
        add a call to the <code>main</code> function. Be certain to
        protect the call to <code>main</code> with an <code>if</code>
        statement as taught in the
        <a href="../lesson05/prepare.html#separate">preparation content
        for lesson&nbsp;5</a>.</div></li>

    <h2 id="mistakes">Common Mistake</h2>

    <h3>Counting Only Three D083 Yogurts</h3>
    <p>Because product number D083 appears twice in the
    <code>request.csv</code> file, your program should not read the
    <code>request.csv</code> file into a dictionary. Recall that each
    key in a dictionary is unique. If your program reads the
    <code>request.csv</code> file into a dictionary, when your program
    reads line 3 of the <code>request.csv</code> file, your program will
    store a request for four yogurts into the dictionary. Then when it
    reads line 6 of the <code>request.csv</code> file, your program will
    replace the request for four yogurts with a request for three
    yogurts. In other words, if your program reads the
    <code>request.csv</code> file into a dictionary, your program will
    think that the customer ordered only three yogurts instead of the
    seven <span class="nowrap">(4 + 3)</span> that he ordered.
    Therefore, your program should not read the <code>request.csv</code>
    file into a dictionary but should instead read and process each row
    similar to <a href="prepare.html#ex3">example&nbsp;3</a> in the
    preparation content for this lesson.</p>
