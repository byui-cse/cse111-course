    <h1>09 Prepare: Text Files</h1>
    <p>During this lesson, you will learn about reading data from text
    files in a Python program.</p>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Most computers permanently store lots data on devices such as
    hard drives, solid state drives, and thumb drives. The data that is
    stored on these devices is organized into files. Just as a human can
    write words on a paper, a computer can store words and other data in
    a file.</p>

    <p>Broadly speaking, there are two types of files:&nbsp; text files
    and binary files. A <dfn>text file</dfn> stores words and numbers as
    human readable text. A <dfn>binary file</dfn> stores pictures,
    diagrams, sounds, movies, and other media as numbers in a format
    that is not directly readable by humans. In this lesson, you will
    learn how to write Python code that reads data from text files.</p>

    <h3 id="textFiles">Text Files</h3>
    <p>In order to read data from a text file, the file must exist on
    one of the computer's drives, and your program must do these three
    things:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Open the file for reading text</div></li>
        <li><div>Read from the file, usually one line of text at a
        time</div></li>
        <li><div>Close the file</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>The built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open"><code>open</code></a>
    function opens a file for reading or writing. Here is an excerpt
    from the official documentation for the <code>open</code>
    function:</p>

    <dl class="function">
        <dt><code>open(filename, mode="rt")</code></dt>
        <dd><p>Open a file and return a corresponding file
        object.</p>
        <p><var>filename</var> is the name of the file to be
        opened.</p>
        <p><var>mode</var> is an optional string that specifies the
        mode in which the file will be opened. It defaults to
        <code>"rt"</code> which means open for reading in text mode.
        Other common values are <code>"wt"</code> for writing a text
        file (truncating the file if it already exists), and
        <code>"at"</code> for appending to the end of a text
        file.</p></dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Example&nbsp;1 contains a program that opens a text file for
    reading at <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;25</span>.
    At <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;29</span> there is a
    <code>for</code> loop that
    reads the text in the file one line at a time and repeats the body
    of the for loop once <code>for</code> each line of text in the file.
    In the body of the <code>for</code> loop at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">lines&nbsp;31&ndash;37</span>,
    the code removes surrounding white space, if there is any, from each
    line of text and then stores each line of text in a list.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex1"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 1

def main():
    # Read the contents of a text file
    # named plants.txt into a list.
    text_list = read_list("plants.txt")

    # Print the entire list.
    print(text_list)


def read_list(filename):
    """Read the contents of a text file into a list and
    return the list. Each element in the list will contain
    one line of text from the text file.

    Parameter filename: the name of the text file to read
    Return: a list of strings
    """
    # Create an empty list named text_list.
    text_list = []

    # Open the text file for reading and store a reference
    # to the opened file in a variable named text_file.
    with open(filename, "rt") as text_file:

        # Read the contents of the text
        # file one line at a time.
        for line in text_file:

            # Remove white space, if there is any,
            # from the beginning and end of the line.
            clean_line = line.strip()

            # Append the clean line of text
            # onto the end of the list.
            text_list.append(clean_line)

    # Return the list that contains the lines of text.
    return text_list


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="ex1">&gt; python example_1.py
['baobab', 'kangaroo paw', 'eucalyptus', 'heliconia', 'tulip',
'chupasangre cactus', 'prickly pear cactus', 'ginkgo biloba']</pre>

    <p>After the body of a <code>for</code> loop that reads from a
    file, we can write a call to the <code>file.close</code> method.
    However, when calling the <code>open</code> function, most
    programmers use a <code>with</code> block as shown in example&nbsp;1
    at <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;25</span> and nest
    the <code>for</code> loop inside the <code>with</code> block as
    shown at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">lines&nbsp;29&ndash;37</span>.
    When the <code>with</code> block ends, the computer will
    automatically close the file, so that the programmer doesn't have to
    write a call to the <code>file.close</code> method.</p>

    <h3 id="csvFiles">CSV Files</h3>
    <p>Many computer systems import and export data in CSV files. CSV is
    an acronym for comma separated values. A <dfn>CSV file</dfn> is a
    text file that contains tabular data with each row on a separate
    line and each cell (column) separated by a comma. The following
    example shows the contents of a CSV file named
    <code>dentists.csv</code> that stores information about dental
    offices. Notice that the first row of the file contains column
    headings, the next four rows contain information about four dental
    offices, and each row contains five columns separated by commas.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="csv">
Company Name,Address,Phone Number,Employees,Patients
Eagle Rock Dental Care,556 Trejo Suite C,208-359-2224,7,1205
Apple Tree Dental,33 Winn Drive Suite 2,208-359-1500,10,1520
Rockhouse Dentistry,106 E 1st N,208-356-5600,12,1982
Cornerstone Family Dental,44 S Center Street,208-356-4240,8,1453
</pre></div>

    <p>Python has a standard module named
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html"><code>csv</code></a>
    that includes functionality to read from and write to CSV files. The
    program in example&nbsp;2 shows how to open a CSV file and use the
    <code>csv</code> module to read the data and store it in a
    dictionary. Remember that each item in a dictionary is a key value
    pair. Notice in example&nbsp;2, because of
    lines&nbsp;<span class="cross" data-ref="ex2">11,&nbsp;16,
    56,&nbsp;and&nbsp;60</span> that the code is using the dental office
    phone numbers as the keys in the dictionary.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex2"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 2

import csv


def main():
    # Indexes of some of the columns
    # in the dentists.csv file.
    COMPANY_NAME_INDEX = 0
    ADDRESS_INDEX = 1
    PHONE_NUMBER_INDEX = 2

    # Read the contents of a CSV file named dentists.csv
    # into a dictionary named dentists. Use the phone
    # numbers as the keys in the dictionary.
    dentists = read_dict("dentists.csv", PHONE_NUMBER_INDEX)

    # Print the dentists dictionary.
    print(dentists)


def read_dict(filename, key_column_index):
    """Read the contents of a CSV file into a dictionary
    and return the dictionary.

        filename: the name of the CSV file to read.
        key_column_index: the index of the column

    with open(filename, "rt") as csv_file:

        # Use the csv module to create a reader object
        # that will read from the opened CSV file.
        reader = csv.reader(csv_file)

        # The first line of the CSV file contains column
        # headings and not information, so this statement
        # skips the first line of the CSV file.
        next(reader)

        # The reader object returns each row as a list.
        for row in reader:

            key = row[key_column_index]

            # into the dictionary.
            dictionary[key] = row

    # Return the dictionary.
    return dictionary


# Call main to start this program.

    main()</pre></div>

    <p>The code in example&nbsp;2 reads the contents of a CSV file and
    stores the contents in a dictionary. However, it is not always
    necessary to store the contents of a CSV file in a dictionary.
    Sometimes a program simply needs to use the values in the CSV file
    in calculations but doesn't need to store the contents of the CSV
    file. In such a situation, the program will still use a for loop but
    will not use a dictionary. The code in example&nbsp;3 processes each
    line in the <code>dentists.csv</code> file to determine which dental
    office has the most patients per employee, but it doesn't use a
    dictionary.</p>
