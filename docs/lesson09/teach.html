    <h1>09 Team Activity: Water Meter Readings</h1>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Arrange a one hour synchronous meeting with your team for this
    activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing meeting.
    Campus students will use class time for this meeting. You should
    prepare for this meeting by completing the preparation material and
    the individual checkpoint assignment beforehand.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Learn more about the <code>pandas</code> module by writing more
    Python code that manipulates the water meter readings from the City
    of Rexburg. Write a Python program that uses the <code>pandas</code>
    module to answer these questions:</p>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="testing">
        <li><div>Run your program and verify that it prints the correct
        results, rounded and formatted as shown in the sample run
        above.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one-hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
    sample solution. Please <strong>do not look at the sample
    solution</strong> until you have either finished the program or
    diligently worked for at least one hour. At the end of the hour, if
    you are still struggling to complete the assignment, you may use the
    sample solution to help you finish.</p>

    <ul class="links">
        <li>Sample solution:
        <a download href="./teach_solution.py">teach_solution.py</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
