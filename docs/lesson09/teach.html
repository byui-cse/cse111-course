    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
    <p>Write a Python program that uses <code>pandas</code> to answer
    these questions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>For the data stored in water.csv, what is the total
        amount of water used?</div></li>

    <h2>Sample Run</h2>
    <pre class="console">&gt; python teach_solution.py
</pre>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one-hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
    sample solution. Please <strong>do not look at the sample
    solution</strong> until you have either finished the program or
    diligently worked for at least one hour. At the end of the hour, if
    you are still struggling to complete the assignment, you may use the
    sample solution to help you finish.</p>

    <ul class="links">
        <li>Sample solution:
        <a download href="./teach_solution.py">teach_solution.py</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
