    <h1>09 Team Activity: CSV Files</h1>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Arrange a one hour synchronous meeting with your team for this
    activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing meeting.
    Campus students will use class time for this meeting. You should
    prepare for this meeting by completing the preparation material and
    the individual checkpoint assignment beforehand.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>A common task for many knowledge workers is to use a number, key,
    or ID to find information about a person. For example, a knowledge
    worker may use a phone number or e-mail address as a key to find (or
    look up) additional information about a customer. During this
    activity, your team will write a Python program that uses a
    student's I-Number to look up the student's name.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <ul class="long">
        <li><div><a href="file_setup.html">This article</a> explains how
        to setup VS Code so that your Python program can read from text
        files.</div></li>

        <li><div>The prepare content for this lesson includes a section
        about <a href="prepare.html#csvFiles">reading CSV files</a>.</div></li>

        <li><div>The prepare content for lesson&nbsp;8 explains how to
        <a href="../lesson08/prepare.html">use dictionaries</a>.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program can call the string
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace">replace method</a>
        to replace all occurrences of a character with another character
        or to remove all occurrences of a character by replacing them
        with the empty string ("").</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Download the
    <a download href="students.csv"><code>students.csv</code></a> file and
    save it in the same folder where you will save your Python program.
    Open the file in VS Code and examine it. Notice that the I-Numbers
    and names in the file are separated by a comma. Notice also that the
    I-Numbers are stored in the file without any dashes between the
    digits.</p>

    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
    <p>Write a Python program named <code>students.py</code> that does
    the following:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Opens the <code>students.csv</code> file for reading,
        skips the first line of text in the file because it contains
        only headings, and reads the other lines of the file into a
        dictionary. The program must store the student I-Numbers as keys
        and the student names as values in the dictionary.</div></li>

        <li><div>Gets an I-Number from the user, uses the I-Number to
        find the corresponding student name in the dictionary, and
        prints the name.</div></li>

        <li><div>If a user enters an I-Number that doesn't exist in the
        dictionary, your program must print the message, "No such
        student" (without the quotes).</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an hour,
    complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that the
    stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Add code to remove dashes from the I-Number that the
        user enters. This will allow the user to enter I-Numbers with
        dashes or without dashes and still allow the computer to search
        in the dictionary.</div></li>

        <li><div>When a user enters an I-Number, your program should
        ensure it is a valid I-Number.</div>
        <ol>
            <li><div>If there are too few digits in the I-Number, your
            program should print, "Invalid I-Number: too few digits"
            (without the quotes).</div></li>

            <li><div>If there are too many digits in the I-Number, your
            program should print, "Invalid I-Number: too many digits"
            (without the quotes).</div></li>

            <li><div>If the given I-Number contains any characters
            besides digits and dashes, your program should output
            "Invalid I-Number" (without the quotes).</div></li>
        </ol></li>

        <li><div>Add something or change something in your program that
        you think would make your program better, easier for the user,
        more elegant, or more fun. Be creative.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>

    <ol class="test long">
        <li><div>Download the <a download
        href="test_students.py"><code>test_students.py</code></a>
        Python file and save it in the same folder where you saved your
        <code>students.py</code> program. Run the
        <code>test_students.py</code> file and ensure that the
        <code>test_read_dict</code> function passes. If it doesn't pass,
        there is a mistake in your <code>read_dict</code> function. Read
        the output from <code>pytest</code>, fix the mistake, and run
        the <code>test_students.py</code> file again until the test
        function passes.

        <li><div>Run your program and enterh this I-Number as input:&nbsp;
        <code>00-115-2306</code> (including the dashes). Many users will
        want to enter I-Numbers with dashes. How should your program
        handle the dashes?</div></li>

        <li><div>Run your program and enter an I-Number with too few
        digits or too many digits. How should your program handle these
        invalid I-Numbers?</div></li>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
    <a class="solution" href="teach_solution.py">sample solution</a>.
    Please <strong>do not look at the sample solution</strong> until you
    have either finished the program or diligently worked for at least
    one hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling to
    complete the assignment, you may use the sample solution to help you
    finish.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
