    <h1>09 Team Activity: CSV Files</h1>

    <section>
    <h2 id="instrucs">Instructions</h2>
    <p>Work as a team as explained in the instructions for the
    <a href="../lesson02/teach.html#instrucs">lesson&nbsp;2 team
    activity</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2 id="problem">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>A common task for many knowledge workers is to use a number, key,
    or ID to find information about a person. For example, a knowledge
    worker may use a phone number or e-mail address as a key to find (or
    look up) additional information about a customer. During this
    activity, your team will write a Python program that uses a
    student’s I-Number to look up the student’s name.</p>

    </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2 id="assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>Download the
    <a download href="students.csv"><code>students.csv</code></a> file
    and save it in the same folder where you will save your Python
    program. Open the file in VS Code and examine it. Notice that the
    I-Numbers and names in the file are separated by a comma. Notice
    also that the I-Numbers are stored in the file without any dashes
    between the digits.</p>

    <p>As a team, write a Python program named <code>students.py</code>
    that has at least two functions named <code>main</code> and
    <code>read_dictionary</code>. You must write the
    <code>read_dictionary</code> function with one of the following two
    headers and documentation strings. Choose the header that makes the
    most sense to you.</p>

<div class="example"><pre class="python">
def read_dictionary(filename):
    """Read the contents of a CSV file into a
    dictionary and return the dictionary.

    Parameters
        filename: the name of the CSV file to read.
    Return: a dictionary that contains
        the contents of the CSV file.
    """
</pre></div>

<div class="example"><pre class="python">
def read_dictionary(filename, key_column_index):
    """Read the contents of a CSV file into a compound
    dictionary and return the dictionary.

    Parameters
        filename: the name of the CSV file to read.
        key_column_index: the index of the column
            to use as the keys in the dictionary.
    Return: a compound dictionary that contains
        the contents of the CSV file.
    """
</pre></div>

    <section>
    <h3 id="required">Core Requirements</h3>
    <p>Your program must do the following:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Open the <code>students.csv</code> file for reading,
        skip the first line of text in the file because it contains only
        headings, and read the other lines of the file into a
        dictionary. The program must store each student I-Number as a
        key and each I-Number name pair or each name as a value in the
        dictionary.</div></li>

        <li><div>Get an I-Number from the user, use the I-Number to find
        the corresponding student name in the dictionary, and print the
        name.</div></li>

        <li><div>If a user enters an I-Number that doesn’t exist in the
        dictionary, your program must print the message, "No such
        student" (without the quotes).</div></li>
    </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h3 id="stretch">Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an hour,
    complete one or more of these optional stretch challenges.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Organize the code in your program into three functions:
        <ul class="long">
            <li><div><code>main()<br>
            """Calls read_dictionary and find_student"""</code></div></li>
            <li><div><code>read_dictionary(filename)<br>
            """Read the contents of a CSV file into a<br>
            dictionary and return the dictionary.</code></div></li>
            <li><div><code>find_student(students_dict)<br>
            """Get an I-Number from the user, verify the I-Number is<br>
            valid, and find and print the student with that I-Number.</code></div></li>
        </ul></div></li>

        <li><div>Add code to remove dashes from the I-Number that the
        user enters. This will allow the user to enter I-Numbers with
        dashes or without dashes and still allow the computer to search
        in the dictionary.</div></li>

        <li><div>When a user enters an I-Number, your program should
        ensure it is a valid I-Number.</div>
        <ol>
            <li><div>If there are too few digits in the I-Number, your
            program should print, "Invalid I-Number: too few digits"
            (without the quotes).</div></li>

            <li><div>If there are too many digits in the I-Number, your
            program should print, "Invalid I-Number: too many digits"
            (without the quotes).</div></li>

            <li><div>If the given I-Number contains any characters
            besides digits and dashes, your program should output
            "Invalid I-Number" (without the quotes).</div></li>
        </ol></li>

        <li><div>Add something or change something in your program that
        you think would make your program better, easier for the user,
        more elegant, or more fun. Be creative.</div></li>
    </ol>
    </section>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2 id="testing">Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>

    <ol class="test long">
        <li><div>Download the <a download
        href="test_students.py"><code>test_students.py</code></a>
        Python file and save it in the same folder where you saved your
        <code>students.py</code> program. Run the
        <code>test_students.py</code> file and ensure that the
        <code>test_read_dictionary</code> function passes. If it doesn't
        pass, there is a mistake in your <code>read_dictionary</code>
        function. Read the output from <code>pytest</code>, fix the
        mistake, and run the <code>test_students.py</code> file again
        until the test function passes.

    <section>
    <h2 id="solution">Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your solution to the
    <a class="solution" href="teach_solution.py">sample solution</a>
    or the
    <a class="solution" href="teach_stretch.py">stretch solution</a>.
    Please do not look at the sample solution until <strong>after you
    have finished the program or diligently worked for one hour</strong>.
    At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling to complete the
    assignment, you may use the sample solution to help you finish.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2 id="submit">Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    in the associated I‑Learn quiz. When the quiz asks about which of
    the requirements you completed, include any work you did during the
    team meeting or later, including work you did with the help of the
    sample solution, if necessary. In short, report on what you
    accomplished, regardless of when you completed it or if you needed
    help from the sample solution.</p>
