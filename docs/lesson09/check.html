    <h1>09 Checkpoint: Water Meter Readings</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Complete this individual checkpoint assignment to demonstrate
    your ability to use <code>pandas</code> to read a CSV file and
    to print a summary of the data.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>In many countries of the world, including the USA, drinking water
    is delivered to houses through underground pipes. Very often this
    water must be filtered and purified before it is put into the pipes.
    Of course, filtering and purification costs money, and most cities
    charge households according to the amount of water that the
    household uses. In order to know how much water a household uses,
    the city inserts a device called a water meter in the pipe
    immediately before each house. The water meter measures how much
    water passes by it in the pipe. An employee of the city comes
    frequently to read and record the amount of water used as shown on
    the meter.</p>

    <p>Employees of the City of Rexburg, Idaho where BYU-Idaho is
    located read the water meters about once each month. For the
    checkpoints and assignments of this lesson and the next, you will
    write Python code that reads and processes a CSV file named
    water.csv that contains water meter readings for five years from
    the City of Rexburg.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Write a Python program with a main function that uses
    <code>pandas</code> to read a CSV file into a <code>DataFrame</code>
    and to manipulate and print the data. Do the following:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Open VS Code and open its terminal window: on the menu
        bar for VS Code, click "Terminal" and then "New
        Terminal".</div></li>

        <li><div>Upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel by executing this
        command:
<pre class="console">python -m pip install --user --upgrade pip setuptools wheel</pre></div></li>

        <li><div>Install the <code>numpy</code>, matplotlib, and pandas
        modules:
<pre class="console">python -m pip install --user numpy matplotlib pandas</pre></div></li>

        <li><div>Download and save this <a download
        href="water.zip">water.zip</a> file.</div></li>

        <li><div>Unzip the file (extract all) into the same folder where
        you will save your Python program. This will unzip the file
        <code>water.csv</code> This file contains water meter
        readings for several years from the City of Rexburg,
        Idaho.</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the unzipped <code>water.csv</code> file in VS
        Code and examine it. Notice that each row in the file contains
        seven columns which are named: meterNumber, meterSize, readDate,
        numberOfDays, usage, accountType, and numberOfDwellings. Notice
        also that this file is large, containing 246,832 lines. In
        Rexburg, each water meter is read about once a month. Each line
        in the <code>water.csv</code> file, except for the first line,
        holds the data from reading one water meter one time.</div></li>

        <li><div>Write a Python program with a <code>main</code>
        function that does the following in this order:
        <ol>
            <li><div>Uses <code>pandas.read_csv</code> to read the
            <code>water.csv</code> file into a
            <code>DataFrame</code>.</div></li>

            <li><div>Prints the DataFrame's <code>.dtype</code>
            attribute.</div></li>

            <li><div>Calls the <code>.describe</code> function and
            prints the summary returned from
            <code>.describe</code></div></li>

            <li><div>Calls the <code>print</code> function to print the
            DataFrame.</div></li>

            <li><div>Filters the DataFrame to include residences
            only.</div></li>

            <li><div>Calls the <code>print</code> function to print the
            filtered DataFrame.</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>
    </ol>
