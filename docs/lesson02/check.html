    <h1>02 Checkpoint: Calling Functions</h1>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>Improve your understanding of calling built-in functions and
    functions that are in a standard Python module.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>In our modern world economy, many items are manufactured in large
    factories, then packed in boxes and shipped to distribution centers
    and retail stores. A common question for employees who pack items is
    "How many boxes do we need?"</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>A manufacturing company needs a program that will help its
    employees pack manufactured items into boxes for shipping. Write a
    Python program named <code>boxes.py</code> that asks the user for
    two integers:&nbsp; 1) the number of manufactured items and 2) the
    number of items that the user will pack per box. Your program must
    compute and print the number of boxes necessary to hold the items.
    This must be a whole number. Note that the last box may be packed
    with fewer items than the other boxes.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <ul class="long">
        <li><div>The <a href="prepare.html">prepare content</a> for this
        lesson explains how to call a function and a method.</div></li>

        <li><div>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.ceil">math.ceil()</a>
        function rounds a number up to the nearest integer that is
        greater than or equal to a number.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sample Runs</h2>
<pre class="console">&gt; python boxes.py
Enter the number of items: <span class="input">8</span>
Enter the number of items per box: <span class="input">5</span>

For 8 items, packing 5 items in each box, you will need 2 boxes.
</pre>

<pre class="console">&gt; python boxes.py
Enter the number of items: <span class="input">25</span>
Enter the number of items per box: <span class="input">4</span>

For 25 items, packing 4 items in each box, you will need 7 boxes.
</pre>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="test">
        <li><div>Run your program and enter the inputs shown in the
        Sample Run section above. Ensure that your program's output
        matches the sample run output.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>When your program is finished, view the <a download
    href="check_solution.py">sample solution</a> for this assignment to
    compare your solution to that one. Before looking at the sample
    solution, you should work to complete this checkpoint program first.
    However, if you have worked on it for at least an hour and are still
    having problems, feel free to use the sample solution to help you
    finish your program.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When complete, report your progress in the associated I-Learn
    quiz.</p>
