    <h1>02 Checkpoint: Review Selection</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Demonstrate your understanding of selection (<code>if</code>
    statements) and logic by completing the following individual
    checkpoint assignment.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>You work for a retail store that wants to increase sales on
    Tuesday and Wednesday, which are the store's slowest sales days. On
    Tuesday and Wednesday, if a customer's subtotal is greater than $50,
    the store will discount the customer's subtotal by 10%.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Write a Python program named <code>discount.py</code> that takes
    a customer's subtotal as input. If the subtotal is greater than $50
    and today is Tuesday or Wednesday, your program must subtract 10%
    from the subtotal. Your program should then compute and output the
    total amount due by adding sales tax of 6% to the subtotal.</p>

    <p>Your program must <strong>not</strong> ask the user to enter the
    day of the week. Instead, it must get the day of the week from your
    computer's clock. At the top of your program, import the
    <code>datetime</code> module like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">import datetime</pre></div>

    <p>Then within your program, use this Python code that will get the
    current day of the week from your computer's clock:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">weekday = datetime.datetime.now().isoweekday()</pre></div>

    <p>If you use the above code, the variable <var>weekday</var>
    will hold 1 if today is Monday, 2 if today is Tuesday, and so on
    to 7 if today is Sunday.</p>

    <h2>Sample Runs</h2>
    <h3>Run on a Monday</h3>
<pre class="console">&gt; python check_solution.py
Please enter the subtotal: <span class="input">42.75</span>
Total: 45.31

&gt; python check_solution.py
Please enter the subtotal: <span class="input">55.20</span>
Total: 58.51</pre>

    <h3>Run on a Tuesday</h3>
<pre class="console">&gt; python check_solution.py
Please enter the subtotal: <span class="input">42.75</span>
Total: 45.31

&gt; python check_solution.py
Please enter the subtotal: <span class="input">55.20</span>
Total: 52.66</pre>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each
    step in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="test long">
        <li><div>If today is any day other than Tuesday or Wednesday,
        run your program using the input shown in the "Run on a Monday"
        section above. Ensure that your program's output matches the
        sample run output. If today is Tuesday or Wednesday, run your
        program using the input in the "Run on a Tuesday"
        section.</div></li>

        <li><div>Is there a simple way to test your program for all the
        days of the week without testing on seven consecutive days and
        without changing your computer's system date? Hint: In your
        program immediately after this line of code:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">weekday = datetime.datetime.now().isoweekday()</pre></div>
        temporarily add a line of code like this one:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">weekday = 3</pre></div></div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>When your program is finished, view the <a download
    href="check_solution.py">sample solution</a> for this assignment to
    compare your solution to that one. Before looking at the sample
    solution, you should work to complete this checkpoint program first.
    However, if you have worked on it for at least an hour and are still
    having problems, feel free to use the sample solution to help you
    finish your program.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When complete, report your progress in the associated I-Learn
    quiz.</p>
