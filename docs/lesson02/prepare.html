    <h1>02 Prepare: Review Python</h1>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics from CSE 110
    that you should review during this lesson.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>In Python, we use <code>if</code> statements to cause
        the computer to make decisions; <code>if</code> statements are
        also called <dfn>selection</dfn> because the computer selects
        one group of statements to execute and skips the other group of
        statements.</div></li>

        <li><div>There are six comparison operators that we can use in
        an <code>if</code> statement:
        <table><thead>
        </thead><tbody>
            <tr><td>&lt;</td> <td>less than</td></tr>
            <tr><td>&lt;=</td> <td>less than or equal</td></tr>
            <tr><td>&gt;</td> <td>greater than</td></tr>
            <tr><td>&gt;=</td> <td>greater than or equal</td></tr>
            <tr><td>==</td> <td>equal to</td></tr>
            <tr><td>!=</td> <td>not equal to</td></tr>
        </tbody></table>
        Here is example code that tests if a number is greater than 500.
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
# Get an account balance as a number from the user.
balance = float(input("Please enter the account balance: "))

# If the balance is greater than 500, then
# compute and add interest to the balance.
if <em>balance &gt; 500</em>:
    interest = balance * 0.03
    balance += interest</pre></div>

        If you have written programs in other programming languages such
        as JavaScript, Java, or C++, you always used curly braces to
        mark the start and end of the body of an <code>if</code>
        statement. However, notice in the example code above that
        <code>if</code> statements in Python do not use curly braces.
        Instead, we type a colon (:) after the comparison of the
        <code>if</code> statement and then indent all the statements
        that are in the body of the <code>if</code> statement. The body
        of the <code>if</code> statement ends with the first line of
        code that is not indented. It may seem strange to not use curly
        braces to mark the start and end of the body of an
        <code>if</code> statement. However, the Python way forces us to
        write code where the indentation matches the functionality or in
        other words where the way we write the code matches the way that
        the computer will execute the code.</div></li>

        <li><div>Python also includes a <dfn>membership operator</dfn>:
        <code>in</code>. We can use the <code>in</code> operator to
        determine if a tuple, list, set, or dictionary contains a value.
        For example:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
names = {"Smith", "Lopez", "Marsh", "Olsen", "Vasiuk"}

family = input("Please enter your family name: ")
if family <em>in</em> names:
    print("Your family name is in the set.")
else:
    print("Your family name is NOT in the set.")</pre></div></div></li>

        <li><div>Each <code>if</code> statement may have an
        <code>else</code> statement. We can combine <code>else</code>
        and <code>if</code> into the keyword <code>elif</code>. For
        example:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
# Get the cost of an item from the user.
cost = float(input("Please enter the cost: "))

# Determine a discount rate based on the cost.
<em>if</em> cost &lt; 100:
    rate = 0.10
<em>elif</em> cost &lt; 250:
    rate = 0.15
<em>elif</em> cost &lt; 400:
    rate = 0.18
<em>else</em>:
    rate = 0.20

# Compute the discount amount and the discounted cost.
discount = cost * rate
cost -= discount

# Print the discounted cost for the user to see.
print(f"After the discount, you will pay {cost}")</pre></div></div></li>

        <li><div>Python includes two <dfn>logic operators</dfn>:
        <code>and</code>, <code>or</code> that we can use to combine two
        comparisons. Python also includes the logical <code>not</code>
        operator. Notice in Python that the logical operators are
        literally the words: <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>,
        <code>not</code> and not symbols as in other programming
        languages:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
if driver &gt;= 54 <em>or</em> (driver &gt;= 32 <em>and</em> passenger &gt;= 54):
    message = "Enjoy the ride!"</pre></div></div></li>

        <li><div>We can cause a computer to repeat a group of statements
        by writing <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops. A
        <code>for</code> loop iterates over a range such as
        <code>range(3, 10)</code> or a sequence such as a list. A
        <code>while</code> loop is more flexible than a <code>for</code>
        loop and repeats while some condition is true. The next code
        example shows four loops. Notice that just like <code>if</code>
        statements, in Python the body of a loop starts and ends with
        indentation.
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
# Count from zero to ten by ones.
for i in range(10):
    print(i)

# Count from zero to ten by twos.
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)

# Count from 100 down to 70 by three.
for i in range(100, 70, -3):
    print(i)

# Print each value in a set.
names = {"Smith", "Lopez", "Marsh", "Olsen", "Vasuik"}
for family in names:
    print(family)</pre></div></div></li>

        <li><div>A <code>break</code> statement causes a loop to end
        early. In the next code example, there is a <code>for</code>
        loop that asks the user to input ten numbers one at a time.
        However, the loop will terminate early if the user enters a zero
        (0).
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
# Get ten or fewer numbers from the user and add them
# together. Notice that this loop uses underscore (_) as
# the counting variable, which is a valid variable name.
# Many programmers use underscore to indicate that the
# variable will not be used within the body of the loop.
sum = 0
for _ in range(10):
    n = float(input("Please enter a number: "))
    if n == 0:
        <em>break</em>
    sum += n
print(sum)
</pre></div></div></li>

        <li><div>The built-in
        <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open"><code>open()</code></a>
        function opens a file for reading or writing. The
        <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects"><code>file.read()</code></a>
        method reads characters or bytes from a file. The
        <code>file.readline()</code> method reads one line of text from
        a text file. The <code>file.readlines()</code> method reads all
        the lines of text from a text file and returns the lines in a
        list.
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
# Open a file named contract.txt and store a
# reference to the opened file in a variable
# named infile.
with open("contract.txt", "rt") as infile:

    # Read the first line of text from the file.
    first = infile.readline()

    # Read all remaining lines of
    # text from the file into a list.
    remain = infile.readlines()
</pre></div></div></li>

        <li><div>Many computer systems import and export data in CSV
        files. CSV is an acronym for comma separated values. A CSV file
        is a plain text file that contains tabular data where each row
        is on a separate line and each cell (column) is separated by a
        comma. The following example is the contents of a CSV file that
        stores information about some dental offices in Rexburg, Idaho.
        Notice that the first row of the file contains column headings,
        the next four rows contain information about four dental
        offices, and that each row contains three columns separated by
        commas.

<div class="pre"><pre class="csv">
Company Name,Address,Phone Number
Eagle Rock Dental Care,556 Trejo Suite C,208-359-2224
Apple Tree Dental,33 Winn Drive Suite 2,208-359-1500
Rockhouse Dentistry,106 E 1st N,208-356-5600
Cornerstone Family Dental,44 S Center Street,208-356-4240
</pre></div>

        Python has a module named <a target="_blank"
        href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html"><code>csv</code></a>
        that includes functionality to read and write data from CSV
        files. The following example code shows how to open a CSV file
        and use the <code>csv</code> module to read and print each row.

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
import csv

# Open a file named dentists.csv and store a
# reference to the opened file in a variable
# named infile.
with open("dentists.csv", "rt") as infile:

    # Use the csv module to create a reader
    # object that will read from the open file.
    reader = csv.reader(infile)

    # Read each row one at a time and
    # print the contents of each row.
    for row in reader:
        company = row[0]
        address = row[1]
        phone = row[2]
        print(company, address, phone)
</pre></div>

        You could use this example code in a program that you write, but
        of course, you could modify the <code>for</code> loop in the
        code to do much more than simply print the contents of each
        row.</div></li>
