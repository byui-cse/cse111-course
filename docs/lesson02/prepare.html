    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics from CSE 110
    that you should review during this lesson.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>In Python, we use <code>if</code> statements to cause
        the computer to make decisions; <code>if</code> statements are
        also called <dfn>selection</dfn> because the computer selects
        one group of statements to execute and skips the other group of
        statements.</div></li>

        <li><div>There are six comparison operators that we can use in
        an <code>if</code> statement:
        <table><thead>
        </thead><tbody>
            <tr><td>&lt;</td> <td>less than</td></tr>
            <tr><td>&lt;=</td> <td>less than or equal</td></tr>
            <tr><td>&gt;</td> <td>greater than</td></tr>
            <tr><td>&gt;=</td> <td>greater than or equal</td></tr>
            <tr><td>==</td> <td>equal to</td></tr>
            <tr><td>!=</td> <td>not equal to</td></tr>
        </tbody></table>
        Here is example code that tests if a number is greater than 500.
<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python" id="ex1">
# Get an account balance as a number from the user.
balance = float(input("Please enter the account balance: "))

# If the balance is greater than 500, then
# compute and add interest to the balance.
if <em>balance &gt; 500</em>:
    interest = balance * 0.03
    balance += interest

# Print the balance.
print(balance)</pre></div>

        <p>If you have written programs in other programming languages
        such as JavaScript, Java, or C++, you always used curly braces
        to mark the start and end of the body of an <code>if</code>
        statement. However, notice in the example code above that
        <code>if</code> statements in Python do not use curly braces.
        Instead, we type a colon (:) after the comparison of the
        <code>if</code> statement as shown on
        <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;6</span>
        above. Then we indent all the statements that are in the body of
        the <code>if</code> statement as shown on
        <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">lines&nbsp;7 and&nbsp;8</span>.
        The body of the <code>if</code> statement ends with the first
        line of code that is not indented, like
        <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;11</span>.</p>

        <p>It may seem strange to not use curly braces to mark the start
        and end of the body of an <code>if</code> statement. However,
        the Python way forces us to write code where the indentation
        matches the functionality or in other words, where the way we
        indent the code matches the way that the computer will execute
        the code.</p></div></li>

        <li><div>Each <code>if</code> statement may have an
        <code>else</code> statement. We can combine <code>else</code> and
        <code>if</code> into the keyword <code>elif</code> as shown on
        <span class="cross" data-ref="ex2">lines&nbsp;7 and&nbsp;9</span>
        in the following example code.

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python" id="ex2">
# Get the cost of an item from the user.
cost = float(input("Please enter the cost: "))

# Determine a discount rate based on the cost.
<em>if</em> cost &lt; 100:
    rate = 0.10
<em>elif</em> cost &lt; 250:
    rate = 0.15
<em>elif</em> cost &lt; 400:
    rate = 0.18
<em>else</em>:
    rate = 0.20

# Compute the discount amount and the discounted cost.
discount = cost * rate
cost -= discount

# Print the discounted cost for the user to see.
print(f"After the discount, you will pay {cost}")</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Python also includes a <dfn>membership operator</dfn>:
        <code>in</code>. We can use the <code>in</code> operator to
        determine if a tuple, list, set, or dictionary contains a value.
        For example:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex3">
# Create a set that contains family names.
surnames = {"Smith", "Lopez", "Marsh", "Olsen", "Vasiuk"}

# Get the user's family name.
family = input("Please enter your family name: ")

# Determine if the user's family name is in the set of family names.
if <em>family in surnames</em>:
    print("Your family name is in the set.")
else:
    print("Your family name is NOT in the set.")</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Python includes two <dfn>logic operators</dfn>:
        <code>and</code>, <code>or</code> that we can use to combine two
        comparisons. Python also includes the logical <code>not</code>
        operator. Notice in Python that the logical operators are
        literally the words: <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>,
        <code>not</code> and not symbols as in other programming
        languages:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex4">
if driver &gt;= 54 <em>or</em> (driver &gt;= 32 <em>and</em> passenger &gt;= 54):
    message = "Enjoy the ride!"</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>We can cause a computer to repeat a group of statements
        by writing <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops. A
        <code>for</code> loop iterates over a range of numbers such as
        <code>range(3, 10)</code> or a sequence such as a list. A
        <code>while</code> loop is more flexible than a <code>for</code>
        loop and repeats while some condition is true. The next code
        example shows three loops that iterate over a range of numbers.
        Notice that just like <code>if</code> statements in Python, the
        body of a loop starts and ends with indentation.

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex5">
# Count from zero to nine by ones.
for i in range(10):
    print(i)

# Count from zero to eight by twos.
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)

# Count from 100 down to 70 by three.
for i in range(100, 69, -3):
    print(i)</pre></div>

        The next code example contains three loops that iterate over the
        elements in a list, set, and dictionary. The code in the body of
        these example loops is very small and simply prints a value.
        However, we can write as much code as we need in the body of a
        loop to repeatedly perform all manner of complex computations.

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex6">
# Create a list.
colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo"]

# Create a set.
names = {"Smith", "Lopez", "Marsh", "Olsen", "Vasiuk"}

# Create a dictionary.
students = {
    "67-412-8350" : "Alan Benson",
    "76-240-1835" : "Madison Silverlake",
    "06-412-7583" : "Samyukta Daniels"
}

# Print each value in a list.
for color in colors:
    print(color)

# Print each value in a set.
for family in names:
    print(family)

# Print each key value pair in a dictionary.
for inumber, name in students.items():
    print(inumber, name)</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>A <code>break</code> statement causes a loop to end
        early. In the next code example, there is a <code>for</code>
        loop that asks the user to input ten numbers one at a time.
        However, the loop will terminate early if the user enters a zero
        (0) because of the <code>break</code> statement.

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex7">
# Get ten or fewer numbers from the user and add them
# together. Notice that this loop uses underscore (_) as
# the counting variable, which is a valid variable name.
# Many programmers use underscore to indicate that the
# variable will not be used within the body of the loop.
sum = 0
for _ in range(10):
    n = float(input("Please enter a number: "))
    if n == 0:
        <em>break</em>
    sum += n
print(sum)</pre></div>
        </div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="validate">Example - Validating User Input</h2>
    <p>The following code example uses <code>if</code> statements inside
    a <code>while</code> loop. The code asks the user to enter an
    integer between a minimum and maximum and verifies that the integer
    is between the minimum and maximum. If the user does not enter an
    integer or enters an integer that is too small or too large, the
    <code>while</code> loop causes the computer to repeatedly ask the
    user to enter an integer until he enters one between the minimum and
    maximum.</p>

    <p><span class="cross" data-ref="ex8">Line&nbsp;16</span> of
    the code example uses the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isdecimal"><code>isdecimal()</code></a>
    method to verify that the user entered only decimal digits. The
    <code>isdecimal</code> method returns True if a string contains at
    least one character and all the characters in the string are decimal
    digits. Otherwise, it returns False. The <code>isdecimal</code>
    method will return False if a string contains any character that is
    not a decimal digit, including the minus sign (-) and the decimal
    separator (.). Unfortunately, this means the following code example
    will not allow a user to enter negative integers and floating point
    numbers.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python" id="ex8">
# The minimum and maximum integers that the user may enter.
minimum = 20
maximum = 40

# Make a boolean variable that will change to
# True after the user enters a valid integer.
valid = False

# Repeatedly ask the user to enter an integer until the
# user enters one between minimum and maximum, inclusive.
while not valid:
    text = input(f"Enter an integer between {minimum} and {maximum}: ")

    # Determine if all the characters that
    # the user entered are decimal digits.
    if <em>text.isdecimal()</em>:

        # Convert the text that the user
        # entered from a string to an integer.
        integer = int(text)

        # Determine if the integer entered by the
        # user is between minimum and maximum, inclusive.
        if integer &lt; minimum:
            print(f"{integer} is too small. Please"
                    " enter another positive integer.")
        elif integer &gt; maximum:
            print(f"{integer} is too large. Please"
                    " enter another positive integer.")
        else:
            # If the computer gets to this line of code,
            # the user entered an integer between minimum
            # and maximum, so change the boolean variable
            # to True so that the loop will stop repeating.
            valid = True

    else:
        # The user entered at least one character that is not a decimal
        # digit, so print a message asking the user to enter an integer.
        print(f"'{text}' is not a positive integer."
                " Please enter a positive integer.")

# Use the integer in the program.
print(integer)</pre></div>

    <p>Some students are confused by the comparison in
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex8">line&nbsp;11</span>:</p>
    <div class="pre"><pre class="python">while not valid:</pre></div>
    <p>The comparison in line&nbsp;11 is equivalent to this
    comparison:</p>
    <div class="pre"><pre class="python">while valid == False:</pre></div>
    <p>Many programmers prefer the comparison as it is written in
    line&nbsp;11 because it reads more like English.</p>
