        <h1>02 Prove: Dictionaries</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Prove that you can write a simple Python program that creates
		a dictionary from a CSV file and allows a user to look up values
		in the dictionary.</p>

        <h2>Project Description</h2>
		<p><a target="_blank" download
		href="products.csv">products.csv</a> is a CSV file that contains
		information about products sold by an online store. Write a
		program that reads products.csv into a Python dictionary and
		allows a user to look up product information by the product
		number.</p>

        <h2>Project Requirements</h2>
        <p>Each row in the products.csv <a target="_blank" download
		href="products.csv">products.csv</a> file contains five columns:
		product #, name, description, category, and price. (Note that
		after you download products.csv you can view its contents by
		opening it in VS Code.) Your program must do the following:</p>

		<ol>
			<li><div>Read the product information from products.csv into
			a Python dictionary.</div></li>

			<li><div>Prompt the user for a product number.</div></li>

			<li><div>Write the prompt code inside of a loop so that if a
			user enters an invalid product number, your program will
			print an error message and prompt the user again.</div></li>

			<li><div>All product numbers in products.csv are composed of
			five decimal digits. Your program must verify that the user
			entered a valid product number.</div>
			<ol>
				<li><div>If the user enters any character that is not a
				decimal digit, your program must print "Invalid
				character in product number" (without the
				quotes).</div></li>
				<li><div>If the user enters fewer than five decimal
				digits, your program must print "Invalid product
				number: too few digits" (without the quotes).</div></li>
				<li><div>If the user enters more than five decimal
				digits, your program must print "Invalid product
				number: too many digits" (without the quotes).</div></li>
			</ol></li>

			<li><div>Your program must look up the product number in the
			dictionary and print the corresponding product name and
			price separated by a comma and a space (", ").</div></li>

			<li><div>Your program should not print the product
			description and category.</div></li>

			<li><div>If the user entered a valid product number (five
			digits) that does not exist in products.csv, your program
			must print "No such product" (without the quotes).</div></li>
		</ol>

		<p>Here are two sample runs of the program.</p>
		<pre>&gt; python3 prove02_instructor.py
Please enter a product number: 38500a
Invalid character in product number
Please enter a product number: 3850
Invalid product number: too few digits
Please enter a product number: 385001
Invalid product number: too many digits
Please enter a product number: 38501
No such product

&gt; python3 prove02_instructor.py
Please enter a product number: 38500
Backpacking Tent, 205.99</pre>
