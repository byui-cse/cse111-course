    <h1>02 Prove: Product Information</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a simple Python program that creates a
    dictionary from a comma separated values (CSV) file and allows a
    user to look up values in the dictionary.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Some companies store and transfer data about suppliers, products,
    customers, employees, and sales in CSV files. A common task that
    employees must do is to look up information that is stored in CSV
    files. Write a Python program that reads the rows of a CSV file into
    a Python dictionary and then allows a user to look up information in
    the dictionary.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>products.csv is a CSV file that contains product information for
    a sales company. Download and save <a download
    href="products.csv">products.csv</a> in the same folder where you
    will save your Python program. After downloading and saving it, open
    products.csv in VS Code. Notice that each row in the products.csv
    file contains five columns: product #, name, description, category,
    and price, in that order. Write a Python program that does the
    following:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Read the product information from products.csv into
        a Python dictionary.</div></li>

        <li><div>Prompt the user for a product number.</div></li>

        <li><div>Write the prompt code inside of a loop so that if a
        user enters an invalid product number, your program will
        print an error message and prompt the user again.</div></li>

        <li><div>All product numbers in products.csv are composed of
        five decimal digits. Your program must verify that the user
        entered a valid product number.</div>
        <ol>
            <li><div>If the user enters any character that is not a
            decimal digit, your program must print "Invalid
            character in product number" (without the
            quotes).</div></li>
            <li><div>If the user enters fewer than five decimal
            digits, your program must print "Invalid product
            number: too few digits" (without the quotes).</div></li>
            <li><div>If the user enters more than five decimal
            digits, your program must print "Invalid product
            number: too many digits" (without the quotes).</div></li>
        </ol></li>

        <li><div>Your program must look up the product number in the
        dictionary and print the corresponding product name and
        price separated by a comma and a space (", ").</div></li>

        <li><div>Your program should not print the product
        description and category.</div></li>

        <li><div>If the user entered a valid product number (five
        digits) that does not exist in products.csv, your program
        must print "No such product" (without the quotes).</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Run</h2>
    <p>Here are two sample runs of the program.</p>
<pre class="console">&gt; python3 prove02_solution.py
Please enter a product number: <span class="input">38500a</span>
Invalid character in product number
Please enter a product number: <span class="input">3850</span>
Invalid product number: too few digits
Please enter a product number: <span class="input">385001</span>
Invalid product number: too many digits
Please enter a product number: <span class="input">38501</span>
No such product

&gt; python3 prove02_solution.py
Please enter a product number: <span class="input">38500</span>
Backpacking Tent, 205.99</pre>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each
    step in this testing procedure:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Run your program using the input shown in the
        sample run section above. Ensure that your program's output
        matches the sample run output.</div></li>
    </ol>
