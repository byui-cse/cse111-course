    <h1>02 Prove: Dictionaries</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a simple Python program that creates
    a dictionary from a CSV file and allows a user to look up values
    in the dictionary.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p><a target="_blank" download
    href="products.csv">products.csv</a> is a CSV file that contains
    information about products sold by an online store. Write a
    program that reads products.csv into a Python dictionary and
    allows a user to look up product information by the product
    number.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Each row in the products.csv <a target="_blank" download
    href="products.csv">products.csv</a> file contains five columns:
    product #, name, description, category, and price. (Note that
    after you download products.csv you can view its contents by
    opening it in VS Code.) Your program must do the following:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Read the product information from products.csv into
        a Python dictionary.</div></li>

        <li><div>Prompt the user for a product number.</div></li>

        <li><div>Write the prompt code inside of a loop so that if a
        user enters an invalid product number, your program will
        print an error message and prompt the user again.</div></li>

        <li><div>All product numbers in products.csv are composed of
        five decimal digits. Your program must verify that the user
        entered a valid product number.</div>
        <ol>
            <li><div>If the user enters any character that is not a
            decimal digit, your program must print "Invalid
            character in product number" (without the
            quotes).</div></li>
            <li><div>If the user enters fewer than five decimal
            digits, your program must print "Invalid product
            number: too few digits" (without the quotes).</div></li>
            <li><div>If the user enters more than five decimal
            digits, your program must print "Invalid product
            number: too many digits" (without the quotes).</div></li>
        </ol></li>

        <li><div>Your program must look up the product number in the
        dictionary and print the corresponding product name and
        price separated by a comma and a space (", ").</div></li>

        <li><div>Your program should not print the product
        description and category.</div></li>

        <li><div>If the user entered a valid product number (five
        digits) that does not exist in products.csv, your program
        must print "No such product" (without the quotes).</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Run</h2>
    <p>Here are two sample runs of the program.</p>
    <pre class="console">&gt; python3 prove02_solution.py
Please enter a product number: <span class="input">38500a</span>
Invalid character in product number
Please enter a product number: <span class="input">3850</span>
Invalid product number: too few digits
Please enter a product number: <span class="input">385001</span>
Invalid product number: too many digits
Please enter a product number: <span class="input">38501</span>
No such product

&gt; python3 prove02_solution.py
Please enter a product number: <span class="input">38500</span>
Backpacking Tent, 205.99</pre>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each
    step in this testing procedure:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Run your program using the input shown in the
        sample run section above. Ensure that your program's output
        matches the sample run output.</div></li>
    </ol>
