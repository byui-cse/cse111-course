    <h1>02 Prove: Validate User Input</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a Python program that validates user
    input and uses that input in calculations.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>While entering input for a program, users occasionally make
    mistakes and enter invalid or incorrect input. A good program
    recovers from user mistakes, informs users about mistakes in clear
    polite language, and gives users an opportunity to correct their
    mistakes.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <p>The <a target="_blank" href="prepare.html#validate">code
    example</a> in this lesson's prepare content shows how to require a
    user to enter a non-negative integer between a minimum and maximum
    value.</p>

    <p>This <a target="_blank" href="https://content.byui.edu/items/a9e60503-b5e7-40f0-bf48-ebf1a7441d25/1/example_02.mp4">short video</a>
    shows a BYU-Idaho faculty member solving a problem that is similar
    to this prove assignment.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>The previous lesson's
    <a target="_blank" href="../lesson01/prove.html">prove assignment</a>
    required you to write a program that computes the approximate volume
    of air inside a tire. Change the program that you wrote for the
    previous lesson's prove assignment so that it validates all three of
    the integers that the user enters while using the program. The
    minimum and maximum for each of the three numbers are as
    follows:</p>

    <table class="center"><thead>
        <tr><th>Quantity</th> <th>Minimum</th> <th>Maximum</th></tr>
    </thead><tbody>
        <tr><th>tire width</th>
            <td class="number">180</td> <td class="number">400</td></tr>
        <tr><th>aspect ratio</th>
            <td class="number">45</td> <td class="number">70</td></tr>
        <tr><th>wheel diameter</th>
            <td class="number">12</td> <td class="number">28</td></tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <h2>Sample Run</h2>
<pre class="console">&gt; python prove_solution.py
Enter the width of the tire in mm (ex 205): <span class="input">tire</span>
'tire' is not a positive integer. Please enter a positive integer.
Enter the width of the tire in mm (ex 205): <span class="input">60</span>
60 is too small. Please enter a positive integer between 180 and 400.
Enter the width of the tire in mm (ex 205): <span class="input">550</span>
550 is too large. Please enter a positive integer between 180 and 400.
Enter the width of the tire in mm (ex 205): <span class="input">205</span>

Enter the aspect ratio of the tire (ex 60): <span class="input">aspect</span>
'aspect' is not a positive integer. Please enter a positive integer.
Enter the aspect ratio of the tire (ex 60): <span class="input">15</span>
15 is too small. Please enter a positive integer between 45 and 70.
Enter the aspect ratio of the tire (ex 60): <span class="input">90</span>
90 is too large. Please enter a positive integer between 45 and 70.
Enter the aspect ratio of the tire (ex 60): <span class="input">60</span>

Enter the diameter of the tire in inches (ex 15): <span class="input">wheel</span>
'wheel' is not a positive integer. Please enter a positive integer.
Enter the diameter of the tire in inches (ex 15): <span class="input">10</span>
10 is too small. Please enter a positive integer between 12 and 28.
Enter the diameter of the tire in inches (ex 15): <span class="input">35</span>
35 is too large. Please enter a positive integer between 12 and 28.
Enter the diameter of the tire in inches (ex 15): <span class="input">15</span>

The approximate volume is 39924.5 milliliters.

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="test">
        <li><div>Run your program and enter the inputs shown in the
        "Sample Run" section above. Ensure that your program's output
        matches the sample run output.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>To submit your program, return to I-Learn and do these two
    things:</p>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Upload your program (the .py file) for feedback.</div></li>
        <li><div>Add a submission comment that specifies the grading
        category that best describes your program along with a one or
        two sentence justification for your choice. The grading criteria
        are:
        <ul>
            <li><div>1. Some attempt made</div></li>
            <li><div>2. Developing but significantly deficient</div></li>
            <li><div>3. Slightly deficient</div></li>
            <li><div>4. Meets requirements</div></li>
            <li><div>5. Exceeds requirements</div></li>
        </ul></div></li>
    </ol>
