Lesson 2 - Calling Functions
Author: [Your Name Here]

Description:
Practice calling built-in functions and standard library functions.

Instructions:
Write a program that:

1. Asks the user to enter a sentence.
   - Prints the length of the sentence.
   - Prints the sentence in uppercase.
   - Prints the sentence in lowercase.
   - Prints the number of words in the sentence.
     (Hint: Use .split() and len())

2. Asks the user to enter a number.
   - Prints the square root of the number.
   - Prints the number rounded to 2 decimal places.
   - Prints the absolute value of the number.

3. (Stretch) Ask for two numbers and check if they are
   close using math.isclose() with abs_tol=0.01.

Example run:
Enter a sentence: this is a sentence
Length of sentence: 18
Uppercase: THIS IS A SENTENCE
Lowercase: this is a sentence
Number of words: 4
Enter a number: -5
Square root of absolute value: 2.24
Rounded number: -5.0
Absolute value: 5.0
Enter first number: 1.0001
Enter second number: 1.001
1.0001 and 1.001 are close.

# Step 1: Ask the user to enter a sentence.
# TODO: Get user input
# TODO: Print length of sentence
# TODO: Print sentence in uppercase
# TODO: Print sentence in lowercase
# TODO: Print number of words in the sentence

# Step 2: Ask the user to enter a number.
# TODO: Get user input and convert to float
# TODO: Print square root (be sure to use abs() first if needed)
# TODO: Print number rounded to 2 decimal places
# TODO: Print absolute value of the number

# (Stretch) Step 3: Ask for two numbers and check if they are close.
# TODO: Get two numbers
# TODO: Use math.isclose() to compare them
# TODO: Print whether they are close
