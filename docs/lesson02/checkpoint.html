		<h1>02 Checkpoint:</h1>

		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Demonstrate your understanding of decisions, <code>if</code>
		statements, and logic by completing the following individual
		checkpoint assignment.</p>

		<h2>Assignment</h2>
		<p>You work for a retail store that wants to increase sales on
		Tuesday and Wednesday, which are the store&rsquo;s slowest sales
		days. Write a defining table and then a program that takes a
		customer&rsquo;s subtotal as input and if the subtotal is greater
		than $50 and today is Tuesday or Wednesday, subtracts 10% from the
		subtotal. Your program should then compute and output the total
		amount due by adding sales tax of 6% to the subtotal. Within your
		program, use this JavaScript code that will get the current day of
		the week from your computer&rsquo;s clock:</p>
		<pre>    let dayOfWeek = new Date().getDay();</pre>
		<p>If you use the above code, the variable <var>dayOfWeek</var>
		will hold 0 if today is Sunday, 1 if today is Monday, and so on to 6
		if today is Saturday.</p>

		<h2>Instructor&rsquo;s Code</h2>
		<p>When you program is finished, please view the
		<a href="check02_instructor.py"
		target="_blank" download>instructor&rsquo;s version</a> of this
		program to compare your program to that one.</p>

		<p>You should work to complete this checkpoint program first,
		without looking at the instructor&rsquo;s code. However, if you
		have worked on it for at least an hour and are still having
		problems, feel free to use the <a href="check02_instructor.py"
		target="_blank" download>instructor&rsquo;s code</a> to help
		you finish your program.</p>

		<h2>Submission</h2>
		<p>When complete, please report your progress in the associated
		I-Learn quiz.</p>
