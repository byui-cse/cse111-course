    <h1>02 Team Activity: Validate User Input</h1>

    <h2>Instructions for Team Activities</h2>
    <p>Beginning with this lesson, each lesson will contain a team
    activity. Team activities are designed to take about an hour and be
    completed by multiple people working together. In face-to-face
    sections of the course, multiple people will sit in front of the
    same computer. In online sections, you will need to coordinate a
    video call, where everyone can see the code that is being written
    and contribute.</p>

    <p>For this lesson, because the teams may not have been defined and
    you have not had a chance to coordinate a meeting time yet, you are
    welcome to complete this team activity individually or with others
    by using Slack, or any other means to collaborate. Even though you
    might not meet with a team this week, to help you see how the team
    activities work, this activity is set up identically to the future
    team activities, including the I-Learn quiz that you will submit
    when finished. When you submit the I-Learn quiz for this team
    activity, you should simply answer "True" to the questions that ask
    if you met with your team, were on time to the meeting, etc. In
    future lessons, you should answer these questions honestly,
    according to what you actually did.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>In our modern world economy, many items are manufactured in large
    factories, then packed in boxes and shipped to distribution centers
    and retail stores. A common question for employees who pack items is
    "How many boxes do we need?"</p>

    <p>While entering input for a program, users occasionally make
    mistakes and enter invalid or incorrect input. A good program
    recovers from user mistakes, informs users about mistakes in clear
    polite language, and gives users an opportunity to correct their
    mistakes.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>A manufacturing company needs a program that will help its
    employees pack manufactured items into boxes for shipping. Write a
    Python program named <code>boxes.py</code> that asks the user for
    two integers: 1) the number of items and 2) the items per box. Your
    program must require the user to enter positive integers and then
    must compute and print the number of boxes necessary to hold the
    items.</p>

    <h2>Order of Development</h2>
    <p>A good way to write this program is to first write simple code to
    get the two integers from the user, compute the number of boxes, and
    print the number of boxes. Then second, add code to validate the user
    input.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.ceil">math.ceil()</a>
    function rounds a number up to the nearest integer that is greater
    than or equal to a number.</p>

    <p>The <a target="_blank" href="prepare.html#validate">code
    example</a> in this lesson's prepare content shows how to require a
    user to enter a non-negative integer between a minimum and maximum
    value.</p>

    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
    <p>Your program must do the following:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Compute and print the number of boxes required to hold
        the items. This must be a whole number. Note that the last box
        may be packed with fewer items than the other boxes.</div></li>

        <li><div>Prompt the user for the number of <em>manufactured
        items</em> and ensure that the user enters an integer greater
        than 0. If the user enters anything that is not an integer
        greater than 0, your program must repeatedly prompt the user to
        enter another integer until he enters an integer greater than
        zero.</div></li>

        <li><div>Prompt the user for the <em>number of items</em> that
        he will pack <em>per box</em> and ensure that the user enters an
        integer greater than 0 and less than the number of manufactured
        items. If the user enters anything that is not an integer
        greater than 0 and less than the number of manufactured items,
        your program must repeatedly prompt the user to enter another
        integer until he enters a correct integer.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an hour,
    complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that the
    stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Review your code and ask yourself if any section of the
        code seems similar to another section. Write down or record the
        starting and ending line number of each similar section. Perhaps
        one of the similar sections could be separated from the other
        code and reused multiple times which would cause the program to
        have fewer lines of code.</div></li>

        <li><div>Discuss with your team how you could write code to
        validate that a user correctly entered any number, including
        negative integers and fractional numbers.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Runs</h2>
<pre class="console">&gt; python teach_solution.py
Enter the number of items: <span class="input">8</span>
Enter the number of items per box: <span class="input">5</span>

For 8 items, packing 5 items in each box, you will need 2 boxes.
</pre>

<pre class="console">&gt; python teach_solution.py
Enter the number of items: <span class="input">hello</span>
'hello' is not a positive integer. Please enter a positive integer.
Enter the number of items: <span class="input">-3</span>
'-3' is not a positive integer. Please enter a positive integer.
Enter the number of items: <span class="input">25</span>

Enter the number of items per box: <span class="input">quit</span>
'quit' is not a positive integer. Please enter a positive integer.
Enter the number of items per box: <span class="input">-7</span>
'-7' is not a positive integer. Please enter a positive integer.
Enter the number of items per box: <span class="input">4</span>

For 25 items, packing 4 items in each box, you will need 7 boxes.
</pre>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="test">
        <li><div>Run your program and enter the inputs shown in the
        "Sample Run" section above. Ensure that your program's output
        matches the sample run output.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
    <a download href="teach_solution.py">sample solution</a>. Please
    <strong>do not look at the sample solution</strong> until you have
    either finished the program or diligently worked for at least one
    hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling to
    complete the assignment, you may use the sample solution to help you
    finish.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
