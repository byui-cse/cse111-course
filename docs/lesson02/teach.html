    <h1>02 Team Activity: Lookup Student Names</h1>

    <h2>Instructions for Team Activities</h2>
    <p>Beginning with this lesson, each lesson will contain a team
    activity. Team activities are designed to take about an hour and be
    completed by multiple people working together. In face-to-face
    sections of the course, means multiple people will sit in front of
    the same computer. In online sections, you will need to coordinate a
    video call, where everyone can see the code that is being written
    and contribute.</p>

    <p>For this lesson, because the teams may not have been defined and
    you have not had a chance to coordinate a meeting time yet, you are
    welcome to complete this team activity individually or with
    others, using Slack, or any other means to collaborate. Even though
    you might not meet with a team this week, to help you see how the
    team activities work, this activity is set up identically to the
    future team activities, including the I-Learn quiz that you will
    submit when finished. When you submit the I-Learn quik for this team
    activity, you should simply answer "True" to the questions that ask
    if you met with your team, were on time to the meeting, etc. In
    future lessons, you should answer these questions honestly,
    according to what you actually did.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>A common task for many knowledge workers is to use a number, key,
    or ID to look up information about a person. For example, a
    knowledge worker may use a phone number as a key to find (or look
    up) information about a customer. During this activity, your team
    will write a Python program that uses a student's I-Number to look
    up the student's name.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <p>A csv file is a text file that contains a list of data. Within
    each row of a csv file, the data items are separated by a character
    which is usually a comma. The name "csv" is an acronym for "comma
    separated values." Python includes functions for processing csv
    files. Read about the Python <code>csv</code> module in one of these
    articles:</p>

        href="https://realpython.com/python-csv/">Tutorial
        about csv files</a> at Real Python</div></li>

        <li><div>Official Python <a target="_blank"
        href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html">documentation
        about the <code>csv</code> module</a></div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>A Python dictionary is a collection of data that is stored in
    pairs of keys and values. The keys are used to store and quickly
    find the values. Read about Python dictionaries in one of these
    articles:</p>

        href="https://realpython.com/python-dicts/">Tutorial
        about dictionaries</a> at Real Python</div></li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Download this file:
    <a download href="students.csv"><code>students.csv</code></a> and
    save it in the same folder where you will save your Python program.
    Open the file in VS Code or another text editor and examine it.
    Notice that the I-Numbers and names are separated by a comma. Notice
    also that the I-Numbers are stored in the file without any dashes
    between the digits.</p>

    <p>Write a Python program that reads the contents of the
    <code>students.csv</code> file and populates a Python dictionary
    while reading the file. The dictionary uses student I-Numbers as the
    keys and student names as the values. After your program populates
    the dictionary from the file, your program must ask the user for an
    I-Number. Your program will then find and print the corresponding
    student's name. Recall that I-Numbers contain nine digits and are
    often typed by users with dashes separating some of the digits like
    this 62-560-1400. However, the I-Numbers in the
    <code>students.csv</code> file don't contain dashes.</p>

    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Your program must read the data in the
        <code>students.csv</code> file and convert that data into a
        Python dictionary with I-Numbers as the keys and names as the
        values.</div></li>

        <li><div>Your program must ask the user for an I-Number and must
        display the student name that corresponds to the given
        I-Number.</div></li>

        <li><div>If a user enters an I-Number that doesn't exist in the
        dictionary, your program must print the message, "No such
        student" (without the quotes).</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an hour,
    complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that the
    stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Add something or change something in your program that
        you think would make your program better, easier for the user,
        more elegant, or more fun. Be creative.</div></li>

        <li><div>Write comments above the lines of code that were
        difficult for you to understand.</div></li>

        <li><div>Add code to remove dashes from the I-Number that the
        user enters. This will allow the user to enter I-Numbers with
        dashes and still allow the computer to search in the
        dictionary.</div></li>

        <li><div>When a user enters an I-Number, your program should
        ensure it is a valid I-Number.</div>
        <ol>
            <li><div>If there are too few digits in the I-Number, your
            program should print, "Invalid I-Number: too few digits"
            (without the quotes).</div></li>

            <li><div>If there are too many digits in the I-Number, your
            program should print, "Invalid I-Number: too many digits"
            (without the quotes).</div></li>

            <li><div>If the given I-Number contains any characters
            besides digits and dashes, your program should output
            "Invalid I-Number" (without the quotes).</div></li>

            <li><div>Write a loop around the code that gets the user
            input. If the user enters an invalid I-Number, the loop
            should repeat so that the user is again prompted to enter an
            I-Number.</div></li>
        </ol></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Runs</h2>
<pre class="console">&gt; python teach_solution.py
Please enter an I-Number (xx-xxx-xxxx): <span class="input">55-123-4151</span>
No such student

&gt; python teach_solution.py
Please enter an I-Number (xx-xxx-xxxx): <span class="input">75-176-6201</span>
James Smith</pre>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="testing">
        <li><div>Run your program using the input shown in the sample
        run section above. Ensure that your program's output matches the
        sample run output.</div></li>

        <li><div>Run your program and give this I-Number as input:
        <code>00-115-2306</code> (including the dashes). Many users will
        want to enter I-Numbers with dashes. How should your program
        handle the dashes?</div></li>

        <li><div>Run your program and give an I-Number with too few
        digits or too many digits. How should your program handle these
        invalid I-Numbers?</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
    sample solution. Please <strong>do not look at the sample
    solution</strong> until you have either finished the program or
    diligently worked for at least one hour. At the end of the hour, if
    you are still struggling to complete the assignment, you may use the
    sample solution to help you finish.</p>

    <ul class="links">
        <li>Sample solution:
        <a href="./teach_solution.py">teach_solution.py</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
