		<h1>02 Team Activity: CSV Files and Lists</h1>

		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Arrange a one-hour synchronous meeting with your team for
		this activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing
		meeting. Campus students will use class time for this
		meeting.</p>

		<p>You should prepare for this meeting by completing the
		preparation material and the individual checkpoint assignment
		beforehand.</p>

		<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
		<p>A common task for many knowledge workers is to use a number,
		key, or ID to look up information about a person. For example, a
		knowledge worker may use a phone number as a key to look up
		information about a customer. During this activity, your team
		will write a Python program that uses a student's I-Number to
		look up the student's name.</p>

		<h2>Assignment</h2>
		<p>Download this file: <a target="_blank" download
		href="students.csv">students.csv</a> and save it in the same
		folder where you will save your Python program.</p>

		<p>Write a Python program that reads the contents of the
		<code>students.csv</code> file and creates two lists while
		reading the file. One list will contain student I-Numbers, and
		the other list will contain student names. After your program
		creates both lists from the file, your program must ask the user
		for an I-Number. Your program will then find the index of that
		I-Number in the first list and use that index to print the
		corresponding student name. Recall that I-Numbers contain nine
		digits and are correctly formatted as xx-xxx-xxxx, where each x
		represents one digit.</p>

		<h3>Core Requirements</h3>
		<ol>
			<li><div>Your program must read the data in the
			<a target="_blank" download
			href="students.csv">students.csv</a> CSV file and convert
			that data into two Python lists of strings.</div></li>

			<li><div>Your program must ask the user for an
			I-Number.</div></li>

			<li><div>Your program must display the student name that
			corresponds to the given I-Number.</div></li>

			<li><div>If a user enters an I-Number that doesn't exist in the
			list of I-Numbers, your program must print the message,
			"No such student" (without the quotes).</div></li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
		<p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an
		hour, complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note
		that the stretch challenges are optional.</p>

		<ol>
			<li><div>Add something or change something in your program
			that you think would make your program better, easier for
			the user, more elegant, or more fun. Be creative.</div></li>

			<li><div>Write comments above the lines of code that were
			difficult for you to understand.</div></li>

			<li><div>When a user enters an I-Number, your program should
			ensure it is a valid I-Number.</div>
			<ol>
				<li><div>If there are too few digits in the I-Number,
				your program should print, "Invalid I-Number: too few
				digits" (without the quotes).</div></li>

				<li><div>If there are too many digits in the I-Number,
				your program should print, "Invalid I-Number: too many
				digits" (without the quotes).</div></li>

				<li><div>If the given I-Number contains any characters
				besides digits and dashes, your program should output
				"Invalid I-Number" (without the quotes).</div></li>

				<li><div>Write a loop around the code that gets the user
				input. If the user enters an invalid I-Number, the loop
				should repeat so that the user is again prompted to
				enter an I-Number.</div></li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Sample Solution</h2>
		<p>Please work diligently with your team for the one-hour
		meeting. After the meeting is over, please compare your approach
		to the sample solution.</p>

		<p>Please <strong>do not look at the sample solution</strong>
		until you have either finished the program or diligently worked
		for at least one hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still
		struggling to complete the assignment, you may use the sample
		solution to help you finish.</p>

		<ul class="links">
			<li>Sample solution:
			<a href="./teach_solution.py">teach_solution.py</a></li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Submission</h2>
		<p>When you have finished the activity, please report your
		progress via the associated I-Learn quiz.</p>

		<p>When asked about which of the requirements you completed,
		feel free to include any work done during the team meeting or
		after the meeting, including work done with the help of the
		sample solution, if necessary. In short, report on what you were
		able to accomplish, regardless of when you completed it or if
		you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
