    <h1>02 Team Activity: Average Response</h1>

    <h2>Instructions for Team Activities</h2>
    <p>Beginning with this lesson, each lesson will contain a team
    activity. Team activities are designed to take about an hour and be
    completed by multiple people working together. In face-to-face
    sections of the course, multiple people will sit in front of the
    same computer. In online sections, you will need to coordinate a
    video call, where everyone can see the code that is being written
    and contribute.</p>

    <p>For this lesson, because the teams may not have been defined and
    you have not had a chance to coordinate a meeting time yet, you are
    welcome to complete this team activity individually or with others
    by using Slack, or any other means to collaborate. Even though you
    might not meet with a team this week, to help you see how the team
    activities work, this activity is set up identically to the future
    team activities, including the I-Learn quiz that you will submit
    when finished. When you submit the I-Learn quiz for this team
    activity, you should simply answer "True" to the questions that ask
    if you met with your team, were on time to the meeting, etc. In
    future lessons, you should answer these questions honestly,
    according to what you actually did.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Many schools, businesses, and other institutions ask their
    stakeholders to complete surveys. Some of the questions on the
    surveys ask the stakeholders to rate some characteristic on a scale.
    For example, BYU-Idaho asks its students this question, "What is
    your overall rating of this course?" Students respond by selecting
    one of these choices:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Very Poor</div></li>
        <li><div>Poor</div></li>
        <li><div>Fair</div></li>
        <li><div>Good</div></li>
        <li><div>Very Good</div></li>
        <li><div>Excellent</div></li>
        <li><div>Exceptional</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>The results of this question are summarized by assigning a number
    from 1 (very poor) to 7 (exceptional) to each response and then
    computing the average of those numbers. Courses that receive an
    average overall rating less than 4 are improved by faculty members
    and curriculum designers.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <ul class="links">
        <li><div><a target="_blank"
        href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files">Reading and Writing Files</a></div></li>
        <li><div><a target="_blank"
        href="https://realpython.com/courses/lists-tuples-python/">Lists and Tuples</a></div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>The <code>responses.txt</code> file contains the numeric rating
    responses from one question on a survey. Download the <a download
    href="responses.txt"><code>responses.txt</code></a> file and save it
    in the same folder where you will save your Python program. Open the
    file in VS Code or another text editor and examine it. Notice that
    each line in the file contains one integer. Each integer represents
    one person's response to one question.</p>

    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
    Write a program that does the following:
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Opens the responses.txt file for reading.</div></li>
        <li><div>Reads each response from the file and converts each
        response from a string to a number and stores all responses in a
        list of numbers.</div></li>
        <li><div>Computes the average value of all the responses and
        prints the number of responses and the average value of the
        responses.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Run</h2>
<pre class="console">&gt; python teach_solution.py
responses.txt
There are 25 responses with an average value of 4.0
14 of the responses are greater than the average.</pre>

    <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an hour,
    complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that the
    stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <p>What happens if a stakeholder doesn't answer a question on a
    survye? What rating should be used for a non answer? Perhaps non
    answers should be skipped and not computed in the average. In the
    <code>responses.txt</code> file, several of the lines contain the
    number -1. The -1 indicates that the stakeholder didn't answer the
    question. Modify your program so that it does the following:</p>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Ignores or skips all responses that are less than
        zero (0).</div></li>
        <li><div>Counts the number of responses that are greater than
        the average response and prints that count.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Run</h2>
<pre class="console">&gt; python teach_solution.py
responses.txt
There are 21 responses with an average value of 4.95
14 of the responses are greater than the average.</pre>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="test long">
        <li><div>Run your program. Ensure that your program's output
        matches the sample run output for the Core Requirements or the
        Stretch Challenges.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
    <a download href="teach_solution.py">sample solution</a>. Please
    <strong>do not look at the sample solution</strong> until you have
    either finished the program or diligently worked for at least one
    hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling to
    complete the assignment, you may use the sample solution to help you
    finish.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
