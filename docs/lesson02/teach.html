    <h1>02 Team Activity: Validate User Input</h1>

    <h2>Instructions for Team Activities</h2>
    <p>Beginning with this lesson, each lesson will contain a team
    activity. Team activities are designed to take about an hour and be
    completed by multiple people working together. In face-to-face
    sections of the course, multiple people will sit in front of the
    same computer. In online sections, you will need to coordinate a
    video call, where everyone can see the code that is being written
    and contribute.</p>

    <p>For this lesson, because the teams may not have been defined and
    you have not had a chance to coordinate a meeting time yet, you are
    welcome to complete this team activity individually or with others
    by using Slack, or any other means to collaborate. Even though you
    might not meet with a team this week, to help you see how the team
    activities work, this activity is set up identically to the future
    team activities, including the I-Learn quiz that you will submit
    when finished. When you submit the I-Learn quiz for this team
    activity, you should simply answer "True" to the questions that ask
    if you met with your team, were on time to the meeting, etc. In
    future lessons, you should answer these questions honestly,
    according to what you actually did.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>While entering input for a program, users ocassionally make
    mistakes and enter invalid or incorrect input. A good program
    recovers from user mistakes, informs users about mistakes in clear
    polite language, and gives users an opportunity to correct their
    mistakes.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <p>The built-in Python <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/functions.html#len"><code>len</code></a>
    function returns the number of characters in a string.</p>

    <p>The string <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/stdtypes.html#str.isdecimal"><code>isdecimal</code></a>
    method checks the characters in a string to see if they are all
    decimal digits or not.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Start with the following Python program and add code that will
    check the user input, and if the input is invalid, prompt the user
    repeatedly until the input is valid. Notice in the following
    program, all product numbers in the <code>products</code> dictionary
    are composed of five decimal digits.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums">
1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9
11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19
21<br>22<br>23<br>24<br>25<br>26<br>27<br>28<br>29
</pre><pre class="python">
# Create a dictionary that holds product numbers and names.
products = {
    38500: "Backpacking Tent",
    27840: "Sit-Stand Desk",
    37992: "Mouse",
    24458: "Subwoofer",
    38323: "USB Cable",
    14392: "Monitor",
    11103: "Sleeping Bag",
    41023: "Cat-6 Network Cable",
    40246: "HDMI Cable",
    23047: "Keyboard",
    20319: "Keyboard",
    32061: "Mouse"
}

# Get a product number from the user.
prod_num = input("Please enter a product number: ")

# Convert the product number from a string to
# an integer, so that this program can find the
# product number in the products dictionary.
prod_num = int(prod_num)

# Find the corresponding product name and print it.
prod_name = products[prod_num]
print(f"{prod_num}: {prod_name}")</pre></div>

    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
    <p>Do the following:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Add a loop around the call to the <code>input</code>
        function on line&nbsp;19, so that if a user enters an invalid
        product number, your program will print an error message and
        prompt the user again.</div></li>

        <li><div>Within the loop and after the call to the
        <code>input</code> function, add code that validates the user
        input.
        <ol>
            <li><div>If the user enters any character that is not a
            decimal digit, your program must print "Invalid character in
            the product number" (without the quotes).</div></li>

            <li><div>If the user enters fewer than five decimal digits,
            your program must print "Invalid product number: too few
            digits" (without the quotes).</div></li>

            <li><div>If the user enters more than five decimal digits,
            your program must print "Invalid product number: too many
            digits" (without the quotes).</div></li>
        </ol></li></div>

        <li><div>If the user enters a valid product number (five decimal
        digits), your program must continue and find the product number
        in the products dictionary and print the corresponding product
        name.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an hour,
    complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that the
    stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>After the user input validation code and immediately
        before the line of code that finds a product number in the
        <code>products</code> dictionary, add code to your program that
        uses an <code>if</code> statement with the Python
        <code>in</code> operator to check if a product number is in the
        <code>products</code> dictionary.
        <ol>
            <li><div>If the product number is not in the
            <code>products</code> dictionary, your program must print
            "No such product" (without the quotes).</div></li>
            <li><div>Otherwise, your program must print the product
            number and name.</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Run</h2>
<pre class="console">&gt; python teach_solution.py
Please enter a product number: 1543a
Invalid character in the product number
Please enter a product number: 15
Invalid product number: too few digits
Please enter a product number: 1502983
Invalid product number: too many digits
Please enter a product number: 15432
No such product: 15432

&gt; python teach_solution.py
Please enter a product number: 23047
23047: Keyboard</pre>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="test long">
        <li><div>Run your program and enter the inputs shown in the
        "Sample Run" section above. Ensure that your program's output
        matches the sample run output.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
    <a download href="teach_solution.py">sample solution</a>. Please
    <strong>do not look at the sample solution</strong> until you have
    either finished the program or diligently worked for at least one
    hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling to
    complete the assignment, you may use the sample solution to help you
    finish.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
