    <h1>03 Checkpoint: Writing Functions</h1>

    <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
    <p>Check your understanding of writing your own functions with
    parameters and then calling those functions with arguments.</p>

    <h2 id="problem">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Many vehicle owners record the fuel efficiency of their vehicles
    as a way to track the health of the vehicle. If the fuel efficiency
    of a vehicle suddenly drops, there is probably something wrong with
    the engine or drive train of the vehicle. In the United States, fuel
    efficiency for gasoline powered vehicles is calculated as miles per
    gallon. In most other countries, fuel efficiency is calculated as
    liters per 100 kilometers.</p>

    <p>The formula for computing fuel efficiency in miles per gallon
    is the following:</p>
    <div class="block formula"><var>mpg</var> = <div class="fract"><div><var>end</var> &minus; <var>start</var></div><div><var>gallons</var></div></div></div>
    <p>where <var>start</var> and <var>end</var> are both odometer
    values in miles and <var>gallons</var> is a fuel amount in U.S.
    gallons.</p>

    <p>The formula for converting miles per gallon to liters per 100
    kilometers is the following:</p>
    <div class="block formula"><var>lp100k</var> = <div class="fract"><div>235.215</div><div><var>mpg</var></div></div></div>

    <h2 id="assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>Write a Python program that asks the user for three numbers:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>A starting odometer value in miles</div></li>
        <li><div>An ending odometer value in miles</div></li>
        <li><div>An amount of fuel in gallons</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Your program must calculate and print fuel efficiency in both
    miles per gallon and liters per 100 kilometers. Your program must
    have three functions named as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div><code>main</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>miles_per_gallon</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>lp100k_from_mpg</code></div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>All user input and printing must be in the <code>main</code>
    function. In other words, the <code>miles_per_gallon</code> and
    <code>lp100k_from_mpg</code> functions must not call the the
    <code>input</code> or <code>print</code> functions.

    <h2 id="helpful_docs">Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <ul class="tutorials long">
        <li><div>The <a href="../lesson02/prepare.html">prepare content for the previous lesson </a>
        explains how to call a function.</div></li>

        <li><div>The <a href="prepare.html">prepare content for this lesson</a>
        explains how to write a function.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
    <p>Copy and paste the following code into a new program named
    <code>fuel_usage.py</code>. Use the pasted code as a design as you
    write your program. Write code for each of the three functions.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
def main():
    # Get an odometer value in U.S. miles from the user.

    # Get another odometer value in U.S. miles from the user.

    # Get a fuel amount in U.S. gallons from the user.

    # Call the miles_per_gallon function and store
    # the result in a variable named mpg.

    # Call the lp100k_from_mpg function to convert the
    # miles per gallon to liters per 100 kilometers and
    # store the result in a variable named lp100k.

    # Display the results for the user to see.
    pass


def miles_per_gallon(start_miles, end_miles, amount_gallons):
    """Compute and return the average number of miles
    that a vehicle traveled per gallon of fuel.

    Parameters
        start_miles: An odometer value in miles.
        end_miles: Another odometer value in miles.
        amount_gallons: A fuel amount in U.S. gallons.
    Return: Fuel efficiency in miles per gallon.
    """
    return


def lp100k_from_mpg(mpg):
    """Convert miles per gallon to liters per 100
    kilometers and return the converted value.

    Parameter mpg: A value in miles per gallon
    Return: The converted value in liters per 100km.
    """
    return


# Call the main function so that
# this program will start executing.
main()</pre></div>

    <h2 id="testing">Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Run your program and enter the inputs shown below.
        Ensure that your program's output matches the output below.
<pre class="console">&gt; python fuel_usage.py
Enter the first odometer reading (miles): <span class="input">30462</span>
Enter the second odometer reading (miles): <span class="input">30810</span>
Enter the amount of fuel used (gallons): <span class="input">11.2</span>
31.1 miles per gallon
7.57 liters per 100 kilometers</pre>
        </div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="solution">Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>When your program is finished, view the <a class="solution"
    href="check_solution.py">sample solution</a> for this assignment to
    compare your solution to that one. Before looking at the sample
    solution, you should work to complete this checkpoint program.
    However, if you have worked on it for at least an hour and are still
    having problems, feel free to use the sample solution to help you
    finish your program.</p>

    <h3 id="call_graph">Call Graph</h3>
    <p>The following call graph shows the function calls and returns in
    the sample solution for this assignment. From this call graph we see
    that the computer starts executing the sample program by calling the
    <code>main</code> function. While executing the <code>main</code>
    function, the computer calls the <code>input</code> and
    <code>float</code> functions. Then the computer calls the
    <code>miles_per_gallon</code> and <code>lp100k_from_mpg</code>
    functions. Finally the computer calls the <code>print</code>
    function which is the end of the program.</p>

    <h2 id="ponder">Ponder</h2>
    <p>After you finish this assignment, congratulate yourself because
    you wrote a Python program with three user-defined functions named
    <code>main</code>, <code>miles_per_gallon</code>, and
    <code>lp100k_from_mpg</code>. Is it important that you know how to
    write your own functions? Why?</p>

    quiz.</p>
