"""Write US National Weather Service forecasts to an HTML file

To successfully use this module to write an HTML file, your code must
first retrieve a weather forecast from the US National Weather Service.
The weather service organizes a weather forecast into periods of time.
Each period covers about 12 hours and is either a day, an afternoon, or
a night. Each period is stored in a Python dictionary with these keys:
number, name, startTime, endTime, isDaytime, temperature,
temperatureUnit, temperatureTrend, windSpeed, windDirection, icon,
shortForecast, and detailedForecast.

After your code retrieves the periods, it should call these functions
from this module:

1. weather_html.create_document - must be called once before the other
functions.
2. weather_html.start_new_row - must be called once at the beginning of
each desired row of periods in the document.
3. weather_html.add_period - must be called once for each period in the
current row.
4. weather_html.write_document - must be called once after your code has
added all desired rows and periods.
