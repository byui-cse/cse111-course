    <h1>03 Team Activity: Writing Functions</h1>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Arrange a one hour synchronous meeting with your team for this
    activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing meeting.
    Campus students will use class time for this meeting. You should
    prepare for this meeting by completing the preparation material and
    the individual checkpoint assignment beforehand.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Health professionals who are helping a client achieve a healthy
    body weight, sometimes use two computed measures named body mass
    index and basal metabolic rate.</p>

    <p>From the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention we read,
    "Body mass index (BMI) is a person's weight in kilograms divided by
    the square of their height in meters. BMI can be used to screen for
    weight categories such as underweight, normal, overweight, and obese
    that may lead to health problems. However, BMI is not diagnostic of
    the body fatness or health of an individual." The formula for
    computing BMI is</p>
    <div class="block expr"><var>bmi</var> = <div class="fract"><div class="numer">10,000 <var>weight</var></div><div class="denom"><var>height</var><sup>2</sup></div></div></div>
    <p>where <var>weight</var> is in kilograms and <var>height</var> is
    in centimeters.</p>

    <p>Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the minimum number of calories
    required daily to keep your body functioning at rest. BMR is
    different for women and men and changes with age. The revised
    Harris-Benedict formulas for computing BMR are</p>
    <div class="block expr">(women) &nbsp;<var>bmr</var> = 447.593 + 9.247 <var>weight</var> + 3.098 <var>height</var> &minus; 4.330 <var>age</var></div>
    <div class="block expr">(men) &nbsp;<var>bmr</var> = 88.362 + 13.397 <var>weight</var> + 4.799 <var>height</var> &minus; 5.677 <var>age</var></div>
    <p>where <var>weight</var> is in kilograms and <var>height</var> is
    in centimeters.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><div>The <a href="prepare.html">prepare content</a> for this
        lesson explains how to write functions.</div></li>

        <li><div>The official Python documentation describes the built-in
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round"><code>round</code> function</a>.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Write a Python program named <code>fitness.py</code> that does
    the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Asks the user to enter four values:
        <ol>
            <li><div>gender</div></li>
            <li><div>birthdate in this format: YYYY-MM-DD</div></li>
            <li><div>weight in US pounds</div></li>
            <li><div>height in US inches</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>
        <li><div>Converts the weight from pounds to kilograms (1 lb =
        0.45359237 kg).</div></li>
        <li><div>Converts inches to centimeters (1 in = 2.54 cm).</div></li>
        <li><div>Calculates age, BMI, and BMR.</div></li>
        <li><div>Prints age, weight in kg, height in cm, BMI, and
        BMR.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Use the following design to write your program. Write code for
    each function that contains the keyword <code>pass</code> and then
    delete the keyword <code>pass</code>. The <code>compute_age</code>
    function is complete and correct, and you should not change it.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
# Import datetime so that it can be
# used to compute a person's age.
from datetime import datetime


def main():
    # Get the user's gender, birthdate, height, and weight.

    # Call the compute_age, kg_from_lb, cm_from_in, body_mass_index,
    # and basal_metabolic_rate functions as needed.

    # Print the results for the user to see.
    pass


def compute_age(birth):
    """Compute and return a person's age in years.
    Parameter birth: a person's birthdate stored as
        a string in this format: YYYY-MM-DD
    Return: a person's age in years.
    """
    birthday = datetime.strptime(birth, "%Y-%m-%d")
    today = datetime.now()

    # Compute the difference between today and the birthday in years.
    years = today.year - birthday.year

    # If necessary, subtract one from the difference.
    if birthday.month &gt; today.month or \
        (birthday.month == today.month and birthday.day &gt; today.day):
        years -= 1

    return years


def kg_from_lb(lb):
    """Convert a mass in pounds to kilograms.
    Parameter lb: a mass in US pounds.
    Return: the mass in kilograms.
    """
    pass


def cm_from_in(inch):
    """Convert a length in inches to centimeters.
    Parameter inch: a length in inches.
    Return: the length in centimeters.
    """
    pass


def body_mass_index(weight, height):
    """Calculate and return a person's body mass index (bmi).
    Parameters:
        weight must be in kilograms.
        height must be in centimeters.
    Return: a person's body mass index.
    """
    pass


def basal_metabolic_rate(gender, weight, height, age):
    """Calculate and return a person's basal metabolic rate (bmr).
    Parameters:
        weight must be in kilograms.
        height must be in centimeters.
        age must be in years.
    Return: a person's basal metabolic rate in kcal per day.
    """
    pass


# Call the main function so that
# this program will start executing.

    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Your program contains complete and correct functions
        named <code>compute_age</code>, <code>kg_from_lb</code>, and
        <code>cm_from_in</code>.</div></li>

        <li><div>Your program contains complete and correct functions
        named <code>body_mass_index</code> and
        <code>basal_metabolic_rate</code>. To be correct, the
        <code>basal_metabolic_rate</code> function must compute BMR
        differently for males and females.</div></li>

        <li><div>Your program contains a function named
        <code>main</code> which gets four values from the user, calls
        the other functions, and prints the results for the user to
        see.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an hour,
    complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that the
    stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Modify your program to print the height values in
        meters instead of centimeters.</div></li>

        <li><div>Modify your program to allow the user to enter weight
        in British stones and add a function named
        <code>kg_from_stone</code>.</div></li>

        <li><div>Modify your program to allow the user to enter height
        as US feet and inches.</div></li>

        <li><div>Add something or change something in your program that
        you think would make your program better, easier for the user,
        more elegant, or more fun. Be creative.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="testing">
        <li><div>Run your program and verify that it prints the correct
        results, rounded and formatted as shown in the sample runs
        below.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Runs</h2>
<pre class="console">&gt; python fitness.py
Please enter your gender (M or F): <span class="input">F</span>
Please enter your birthdate (YYYY-MM-DD): <span class="input">2001-03-21</span>
Enter your weight in US pounds: <span class="input">125</span>
Enter your height in US inches: <span class="input">54</span>
Age (years): 19
Weight (kg): 56.7
Height (cm): 137.2
Body mass index: 30.1
Basal metabolic rate (kcal/day): 1315</pre>

<pre class="console">&gt; python fitness.py
Please enter your gender (M or F): <span class="input">M</span>
Please enter your birthdate (YYYY-MM-DD): <span class="input">2003-11-26</span>
Enter your weight in US pounds: <span class="input">145</span>
Enter your height in US inches: <span class="input">58</span>
Age (years): 17
Weight (kg): 65.77
Height (cm): 147.3
Body mass index: 30.3
Basal metabolic rate (kcal/day): 1580</pre>

    <ul class="note"><li>Note that the output of your program will not
    be the same for the Age and BMR values because a computer executed
    the sample runs before you executed your program. Therefore, when
    you run your program, the people will be older than they were when
    the computer completed the sample runs.</li></ul>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
    <a download href="teach_solution.py">sample solution</a>. Please
    <strong>do not look at the sample solution</strong> until you have
    either finished the program or diligently worked for at least one
    hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling to
    complete the assignment, you may use the sample solution to help you
    finish.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
