    <h1>03 Team Activity: Using Dictionaries</h1>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Arrange a one hour synchronous meeting with your team for this
    activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing meeting.
    Campus students will use class time for this meeting. You should
    prepare for this meeting by completing the preparation material and
    the individual checkpoint assignment beforehand.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>A common task for many knowledge workers is to use a number, key,
    or ID to look up information about a person. For example, a
    knowledge worker may use a phone number or e-mail address as a key
    to find (or look up) additional information about a customer. During
    this activity, your team will write a Python program that uses a
    student's I-Number to look up the student's name.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="file_setup.html">This article</a>
    explains how to setup VS Code so that your Python program can read
    from files.</p>

    <p>The prepare content for this lesson includes a section about
    <a target="_blank" href="prepare.html#dicts">using dictionaries</a>
    and a section about
    <a target="_blank" href="prepare.html#csvFiles">reading CSV files</a>.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Download the
    <a download href="pupils.csv"><code>pupils.csv</code></a> file and
    save it in the same folder where you will save your Python program.
    Open the file in VS Code and examine it. Notice that the I-Numbers
    and names in the file are separated by a comma. Notice also that the
    I-Numbers are stored in the file without any dashes between the
    digits.</p>

    <p>Write a Python program named <code>pupils.py</code> that does the
    following:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Opens the <code>pupils.csv</code> file for
        reading.</div></li>

        <li><div>Skips the first line of text in the file.</div></li>

        <li><div>Reads the other lines of the file into a dictionary.
        The program must store the student I-Numbers as keys and the
        student names as values in the dictionary.</div></li>

        <li><div>Prints the entire dictionary.</div></li>

        <li><div>Gets an I-Number from the user.</div></li>

        <li><div>Uses the I-Number to find the corresponding student
        name in the dictionary and prints the name.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Your program must read the data in the
        <code>pupils.csv</code> file and convert that data into a Python
        dictionary with I-Numbers as the keys and names as the
        values.</div></li>

        <li><div>Your program must ask the user for an I-Number and must
        display the student name that corresponds to the given
        I-Number.</div></li>

        <li><div>If a user enters an I-Number that doesn't exist in the
        dictionary, your program must print the message, "No such
        student" (without the quotes).</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an hour,
    complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that the
    stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Add something or change something in your program that
        you think would make your program better, easier for the user,
        more elegant, or more fun. Be creative.</div></li>

        <li><div>Write comments above the lines of code that were
        difficult for you to understand.</div></li>

        <li><div>Add code to remove dashes from the I-Number that the
        user enters. This will allow the user to enter I-Numbers with
        dashes or without dashes and still allow the computer to search
        in the dictionary.</div></li>

        <li><div>When a user enters an I-Number, your program should
        ensure it is a valid I-Number.</div>
        <ol>
            <li><div>If there are too few digits in the I-Number, your
            program should print, "Invalid I-Number: too few digits"
            (without the quotes).</div></li>

            <li><div>If there are too many digits in the I-Number, your
            program should print, "Invalid I-Number: too many digits"
            (without the quotes).</div></li>

            <li><div>If the given I-Number contains any characters
            besides digits and dashes, your program should output
            "Invalid I-Number" (without the quotes).</div></li>

            <li><div>Write a loop around the code that gets the user
            input. If the user enters an invalid I-Number, the loop
            should repeat so that the user is again prompted to enter an
            I-Number.</div></li>
        </ol></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Runs</h2>
<pre class="console">&gt; python teach_solution.py
Please enter an I-Number (xx-xxx-xxxx): <span class="input">55-123-4151</span>
No such student

&gt; python teach_solution.py
Please enter an I-Number (xx-xxx-xxxx): <span class="input">75-176-6201</span>
James Smith</pre>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="test long">
        <li><div>Run your program using the input shown in the sample
        run section above. Ensure that your program's output matches the
        sample run output.</div></li>

        <li><div>Run your program and give this I-Number as input:
        <code>00-115-2306</code> (including the dashes). Many users will
        want to enter I-Numbers with dashes. How should your program
        handle the dashes?</div></li>

        <li><div>Run your program and give an I-Number with too few
        digits or too many digits. How should your program handle these
        invalid I-Numbers?</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
    <a download href="teach_solution.py">sample solution</a>. Please
    <strong>do not look at the sample solution</strong> until you have
    either finished the program or diligently worked for at least one
    hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling to
    complete the assignment, you may use the sample solution to help you
    finish.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
