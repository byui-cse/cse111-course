		<h1>01 Team Activity</h1>

		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Arrange a one-hour synchronous meeting with your team for
		this activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing
		meeting. Campus students will use class time for this
		meeting.</p>

		<p>You should prepare for this meeting by completing the
		preparation material and the individual checkpoint assignment
		beforehand.</p>

		<h2>The Problem</h2>
		<p>When you physically exercise to strengthen your heart, you
		should maintain your heart rate within a range. To find that
		range, subtract your age from 220. This difference is your
		maximum heart rate per minute. Your heart simply will not beat
		faster than this maximum (220 &minus; age). When exercising to
		strengthen your heart, you should keep your heart rate between
		65% and 85% of your heart&rsquo;s maximum.</p>

		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>Write a Python program that asks for a person&rsquo;s age and
		computes and outputs the slowest and fastest rates necessary to
		strengthen his heart.</p>

		<h3>Core Requirements</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Your program must compute the slowest and fastest
			beneficial heart rates for someone trying to strengthen her
			heart with physical exercise.</li>
			<li>If the user enters an invalid age, including any
			letters, numbers with a decimal place, and a negative
			number, your program must output "Invalid age" and not
			perform the calcuations nor output anything else.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>If the user enters an age less than 12, your program
			should print, "The formulas used by this program are not
			valid for people younger than 12 years-old." (without the
			quotes), and your program should not perform the
			calculations nor output anything else.</li>
			<li>If the user enters an age greater than 80, your program
			should change the age to 80 and perform and output the
			calculations.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Instructor Code</h2>
		<p>Please work diligently with your team for the one-hour
		meeting. After the meeting is over, please compare your approach
		to the provided instructor code.</p>

		<p>Please <strong>do not look at the instructor code</strong>
		until you have either finished the program or diligently worked
		for at least one hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still
		struggling to complete the assignment, you may use the
		instructor code to help you finish.</p>

		</ul>

		<h2>Submission</h2>
		<p>When you have finished the activity, please report your
		progress via the associated I-Learn quiz.</p>

		<p>When asked about which of the requirements you completed,
		feel free to include any work done during the team meeting or
		after the meeting, including work done with the help of the
		instructor code, if necessary. In short, report on what you were
		able to accomplish, regardless of when you completed it or if
		you needed help from the instructor code.</p>
