    <h1>03 Team Activity: Randomly Chosen Quotes</h1>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Arrange a one hour synchronous meeting with your team for this
    activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing meeting.
    Campus students will use class time for this meeting. You should
    prepare for this meeting by completing the preparation material and
    the individual checkpoint assignment beforehand.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>When working on a long task or completing a long term goal,
    people sometimes find it difficult to stay motivated. Some people
    find that inspiring quotes from others who accomplished similar
    tasks help them to stay motivated. During this activity, your team
    will write a Python program that prints a quote choosen randomly
    from a file of quotes.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <p>The Python <code>random</code> module contains functions to
    generate pseudo random numbers and to make pseudo random choices.
    Read about the <code>random</code> module in one of these
    articles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div><a target="_blank"
        href="https://realpython.com/lessons/random-data-generation-python/">Lesson about <code>random</code></a>
        at Real Python</div></li>
        <li><div>Official Python <a target="_blank"
        href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html">documentation
        about the <code>random</code> module</a></div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Python <code>textwrap</code> module contains functions to
    format plain text. The module formats text by adding, removing, and
    moving line breaks in the input text. Read about the
    <code>textwrap</code> module in this article:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>Official Python <a target="_blank"
        href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/textwrap.html">documentation
        about the <code>textwrap</code> module</a></div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Download this file: <a download href="quotes.txt">quotes.txt</a>
    and save it in the same folder where you will save your Python
    program.</p>

    <p>Write a Python program that reads the contents of the
    <code>quotes.txt</code> file into a list and then randomly chooses
    one of the quotes and prints it for the user to see. Include these
    two lines of code at the top of your program to import the functions
    in the <code>random</code> and <code>textwrap</code> modules:</p>

<pre class="python">import random
import textwrap</pre>

    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Your program must read the quotes from the
        <code>quotes.txt</code> file into a list and randomly choose one
        of the quotes from the list.</div></li>

        <li><div>Your program must wrap the words in the quote onto
        multiple lines if the quote is longer than 70 characters and
        then print the wrapped quote for the user to see.</div></li>

        <li><div>Your program must call the following functions:
        <ul>
            <li><div><code>open</code> - to open the
            <code>quotes.txt</code> file.</div></li>
            <li><div><code>file.readlines</code> - to read all the lines
            in the file as a list</div></li>
            <li><div><code>random.choice</code> - to randomly choose one
            of the quotes</div></li>
            <li><div><code>textwrap.wrap</code> - to wrap the words of
            the chosen quote to 70 characters or fewer per
            line</div></li>
            <li><div><code>print</code> - to print the wrapped lines of
            the quote</div></li>
        </ul></div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an hour,
    complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that the
    stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Add something or change something in your program that
        you think would make your program better, easier for the user,
        more elegant, or more fun. Be creative.</div></li>

        <li><div>Write comments above the lines of code that were
        difficult for you to understand.</div></li>

        <li><div>Change the call to the <code>textwrap.wrap</code>
        function to wrap the words in the quote to 50 characters instead
        of 70.</div></li>

        <li><div>Allow the user to enter a positive integer to choose
        how many quotes are chosen and printed.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Run</h2>
<pre class="console">&gt; python teach_solution.py
How many quotes would you like? 2

The way to right wrongs is to turn the light of
truth upon them. -Ida B. Wells

How dare you settle for less when the world has
made it so easy for you to be remarkable? -Seth
Godin</pre>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="testing">
        <li><div>Run your program and verify that it outputs a quote (or
        multiple quotes if you completed stretch challenge #4).</div></li>
        <li><div>Run your program again and verify that it outputs a
        different quote.</div></li>
        <li><div>If the quotes that you program printed are short, run
        your program again until it prints a long quote that wraps onto
        two or more lines. Verify that each line contains no more than
        70 characters.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one-hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
    sample solution. Please <strong>do not look at the sample
    solution</strong> until you have either finished the program or
    diligently worked for at least one hour. At the end of the hour, if
    you are still struggling to complete the assignment, you may use the
    sample solution to help you finish.</p>

    <ul class="links">
        <li>Sample solution:
        <a href="./teach_solution.py">teach_solution.py</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
