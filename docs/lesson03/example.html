    <h1>03 Example: Using Dictionaries</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a Python program that reads CSV files
    and creates, populates, and uses a dictionary.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>A local music teacher has a large collection of recorded music.
    He has a CSV file named <code>all_music.csv</code> that contains
    information about all of his music. He also has a playlist stored
    in a text file named <code>evening.txt</code>. He wants to know how
    long it will take to listen to the songs in the playlist.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="file_setup.html">This article</a>
    explains how to setup VS Code so that your Python program can read
    from files.</p>

    <p>The prepare content for this lesson includes a section about
    <a target="_blank" href="prepare.html#dicts">using dictionaries</a>
    and a section about
    <a target="_blank" href="prepare.html#csvFiles">reading CSV files</a>.</p>

    <p>The prepare content for this lesson includes a section about
    <a target="_blank" href="prepare.html#lists">using lists</a>
    and a section about
    <a target="_blank" href="prepare.html#textFiles">reading text files</a>.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Write a program that does the following:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Reads the data in the <code>all_music.csv</code> file
        and stores it in a dictionary named <code>all_music</code> with
        the song title as the key.</div></li>

        <li><div>Reads the titles from the <code>evening.txt</code>
        playlist.</div></li>

        <li><div>For each title in the playlist does the
        following:
        <ol>
            <li><div>Finds the title in the <code>all_music</code>
            dictionary.</div></li>
            <li><div>Gets the length in seconds of the song.</div></li>
            <li><div>Prints the song title and length in seconds.</div></li>
            <li><div>Adds the length to a total.</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>

        <li><div>Prints the total length of the playlist in minutes.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>

    <ol class="test">
        <li><div>Run your program and verify that it prints the
        <var>products</var> dictionary and requested items as shown in
        the "Sample Run" section above. The output of your program
        should contain the same data as above but does not have to be
        formatted exactly the same as above.</div></li>
