    <h1>03 Prove Milestone: Using Dictionaries</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a Python program that reads CSV files
    and creates, populates, and uses dictionaries.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>A local grocery store subscribes to an online service that
    enables their customers to order groceries online. After a customer
    completes an order, the online service sends a CSV file that
    contains the customer's requests to the grocery store. The store
    needs you to write a program that reads the CSV file and prints (to
    the terminal window) a receipt that lists the purchased items and
    shows the subtotal, the sales tax amount, and the total.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="file_setup.html">This article</a>
    explains how to setup VS Code so that your Python program can read
    from files.</p>

    <p>The prepare content for this lesson includes a section about
    <a target="_blank" href="prepare.html#dicts">using dictionaries</a>
    and a section about
    <a target="_blank" href="prepare.html#csvFiles">reading CSV files</a>.</p>

    shows a BYU-Idaho faculty member solving a problem that is similar
    to this prove assignment.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>During this milestone (lesson 3), you will write half of this
    Python program. Specifically, by the end of this milestone, your
    program will read and process these two CSV files:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>The <code>products.csv</code> file is a catalog of
            all the products that the grocery store sells.</div></li>
        <li><div>The <code>request.csv</code> file contains the items
            ordered by a customer.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Do the following:</p>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Download both of these files:
        <a download href="products.csv">products.csv</a> and
        <a download href="request.csv">request.csv</a> and
        save them into the same folder where you will save your Python
        program.</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the <code>products.csv</code> file in VS Code and
        examine it. Notice that each row in this file contains three
        values separated by commas: a product number, a product name,
        and a retail price.</div></li>

        <li><div>In VS Code, create a new file, import the
        <code>csv</code> module, and save the new file as
        <code>receipt.py</code> in the same folder where you saved the
        <code>products.csv</code> and <code>request.csv</code>
        files.</div></li>

        <li><div><p>Write code in <code>receipt.py</code> that will open
        the <code>products.csv</code> file for reading and populate a
        dictionary named <var>products</var> with the contents of the
        <code>products.csv</code> file. In the next part of your
        program, your program will use this <var>products</var>
        dictionary to look up product names and prices.</p>

        <p>Recall that each item in a dictionary has a key and a value.
        Each item in the <var>products</var> dictionary must have a
        product number as the key and a list with the product name and
        price as the value. This organization is shown in the following
        table.</p>

        <table class="center"><thead>
            <tr><th colspan="2">Products</th></tr>
            <tr><th>Key</th> <th>Value</th></tr>
        </thead><tbody>
            <tr><td>"D150"</td> <td>["1 gallon milk", 2.85]</td></tr>
            <tr><td>"D083"</td> <td>["1 cup yogurt", 0.75]</td></tr>
            <tr><td>"P143"</td> <td>["1 lb baby carrots", 1.39]</td></tr>
            <tr><td>"W231"</td> <td>["32 oz granola", 3.21]</td></tr>
            <tr><td>"W112"</td> <td>["wheat bread", 2.55]</td></tr>
            <tr><td>"C013"</td> <td>["twix candy bar", 0.85]</td></tr>
        <tbody></table></div></li>

        <li><div>In your <code>receipt.py</code> program, after the code
        that populates the <var>products</var> dictionary, write a line
        of code to print the entire <var>products</var> dictionary. Run
        your program and verify that your printed dictionary contains
        the same data as shown in the previous table.</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the <code>request.csv</code> file in VS Code and
        examine it. Notice that each row contains only two values, a
        product number and a quantity.</div></li>

        <li><div>At the bottom of your <code>receipt.py</code> program,
        write code that will open the <code>request.csv</code> file for
        reading. Write a loop that will read and process each row from
        the <code>request.csv</code> file. Within the body of the loop,
        your program must do the following for each row:
        <ol>
            <li><div>Use the requested product number to retrieve the
            corresponding product name and price from the
            <var>products</var> dictionary.</div></li>
            <li><div>Print the product name, requested quantity, and
            product price.</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Run</h2>
<pre class="console">&gt; python receipt.py

Products
{'D150': ['1 gallon milk', 2.85],
'D083': ['1 cup yogurt', 0.75],
'P143': ['1 lb baby carrots', 1.39],
'W231': ['32 oz granola', 3.21],
'W112': ['wheat bread', 2.55],
'C013': ['twix candy bar', 0.85]}

Requested Items
1 gallon milk: 2 @ 2.85
32 oz granola: 1 @ 3.21
1 cup yogurt: 4 @ 0.75
twix candy bar: 2 @ 0.85</pre>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>

    <ol class="test">
        <li><div>Run your program and verify that it prints the
        <var>products</var> dictionary and requested items as shown in
        the "Sample Run" section above. The output of your program
        should contain the same data as above but does not have to be
        formatted exactly the same as above.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>On or before the due date, return to I-Learn and report your
    progress on this milestone.</p>
