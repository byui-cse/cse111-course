    <h1>03 Prove Milestone: Weather Forecast</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a Python program that calls
    functions.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>The weather affects people's lives for good and bad every day.
    Because of the impact of the weather on people's lives, the United
    States Federal Government sponsors the U.S. National Weather Service
    which forecasts the weather throughout the entire United States
    every day. These weather forecasts are available for free as a web
    service on the internet. Write a Python program to do the
    following:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Allow a user to select a city from a list of
        cities.</div></li>
        <li><div>Retrieve weather forecast for the next seven days and
        nights from the U.S. National Weather Service.</div></li>
        <li><div>Write the forecast to an HTML file that a user can view
        in a browser.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>During this assignment (lesson 3), you will write half of this
    Python program. During this assignment, your program will not
    retrieve the forecast from the U.S. Weather Service, but it will
    instead use two sample forecasts and write those forecasts to an
    HTML file. During lesson 4, you will add the code to prompt the user
    for their desired city and to retrieve a forecast from the U.S.
    Weather Service.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <p>The Python <code>weather_html</code> module was written at
    BYU-Idaho and accepts U.S. National Weather Service forecasts and
    writes HTML to a file. To prepare for this assignment, read about
    the
    <a target="_blank" href="weather_html.html"><code>weather_html</code> module</a>
    and its functions.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Do the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Download both of these files:
        <a download href="weather_html.py">weather_html.py</a> and
        <a download href="test_periods.py">test_periods.py</a> and
        save them into the same folder where you will save your Python
        program.</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the <code>weather_html.py</code> file and examine
        it. Notice that this file is the <code>weather_html</code>
        module and contains the four functions:
        <code>create_report</code>, <code>start_new_row</code>,
        <code>add_period</code>, <code>write_report</code> that are
        described in the module's documentation.</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the <code>test_periods.py</code> file and notice
        that it contains two lists:
        <code>periods_that_start_with_a_day</code> and
        <code>periods_that_start_with_a_night</code>. You will use these
        two lists to test your program during this
        assignment.</div></li>

        <li><div>Use this code to begin your Python program:
<pre>import test_periods
import weather_html

city_name = "Rexburg, Idaho"
periods = test_periods.periods_that_start_with_a_day
# periods = test_periods.periods_that_start_with_a_night</pre></div></li>

        <li><div>Finish your program by writing code to call the four
        functions from the <code>weather_html</code> module as necessary
        to produce an HTML document in a five day vertical format. Your
        program should also include <code>if</code> statements as
        necessary and a loop to iterate through the
        <code>periods</code>. See the "Testing Procedure" section below
        for sample reports.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Run your program and double click on the HTML file that
        you program produces. Double clicking the HTML file should open
        it in a browser. Look in the browser at the document that your
        program produced and verify that it looks like this sample
        <a target="_blank"
        href="forecast5day.html">forecast5day.html</a> document. This
        sample document came from the
        <code>periods_that_start_with_a_day</code> list and therefore
        begins with a day period.</div></li>

        <li><div>Change your program to use the
        <code>periods_that_start_with_a_night</code> list and then run
        your program again. Double click on the HTML file and verify
        that the document that your program produced now looks like this
        sample <a target="_blank"
        href="forecast5night.html">forecast5night.html</a> document.
        This sample document came from the
        <code>periods_that_start_with_a_night</code> list and therefore
        begins with a night period.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>To submit your program, return to I-Learn and do these two
        things:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><div>Upload your program (the .py file) for feedback.</div></li>
            <li><div>Add a submission comment that specifies the grading
            category that best describes your program along with a one or
            two sentence justification for your choice. The grading criteria
            are:
            <ul>
                <li><div>1. Some attempt made</div></li>
                <li><div>2. Developing but significantly deficient</div></li>
                <li><div>3. Slightly deficient</div></li>
                <li><div>4. Meets requirements</div></li>
                <li><div>5. Exceeds requirements</div></li>
            </ul></div></li>
        </ol>
