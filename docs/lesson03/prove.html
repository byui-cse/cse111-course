        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Write a Python program that calls built-in functions, standard functions, and functions in a third party library.</p>

        <h2>Project Description</h2>
		<p>In the spring of 2019, several BYU-Idaho students created a small Android app to help people  vocabulary words in a foreign language. This app stores the vocabulary words in a centralized firebase database. Your assignment during lessons 3 and 4 is to write a Python program that runs on your computer and enables a user to do the following:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>select a language</li>
			<li>list all of the words stored in the database for that language</li>
			<li>find a word and its translation in the database</li>
			<li>add a new word and its translation to the database</li>
		</ol>
