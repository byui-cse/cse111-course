    <h1>03 Prove: Milestone</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a Python program that calls
    functions.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>The weather affects people's lives for good and bad every
    day. Because of the impact of the weather on people's lives, the
    United States Federal Government sponsors the U.S. National
    Weather Service which forecasts the weather throughout the
    entire United States every day. These weather forecasts are
    available for free as a web service on the internet. Write a
    Python program that</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>allows a user to select a city from a list of
        cities</div></li>
        <li><div>retrieves weather forecast for the next seven days
        and nights from the U.S. National Weather Service</div></li>
        <li><div>writes the forecast to an HTML file that a user
        can view in a browser</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>During this assignment (lesson 3), you will write half of
    this Python program. During this assignment, your program will
    not retrieve the forecast from the U.S. Weather Service but will
    instead use two sample forecasts and will write those forecasts
    to an HTML file. During lesson 4, you will add the code to
    prompt the user for their desired city and to retrieve a
    forecast from the U.S. Weather Service.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <p>The Python <code>weather_html</code> module was written at
    BYU-Idaho and accepts U.S. National Weather Service forecasts
    and writes HTML to a file. To prepare for this assignment, read
    about the
    <a target="_blank" href="weather_html.html"><code>weather_html</code> module</a>
    and its functions.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Do the following:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Download both of these files:
        <a target="_blank" download href="weather_html.py">weather_html.py</a> and
        <a target="_blank" download href="test_periods.py">test_periods.py</a>
        and save them into the same folder where you will save your
        Python program.</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the <code>weather_html.py</code> file and
        examine it. Notice that this file is the
        <code>weather_html</code> module and contains the four
        functions: <code>create_report</code>,
        <code>start_new_row</code>, <code>add_period</code>,
        <code>write_report</code> that are described in the module's
        documentation.</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the <code>test_periods.py</code> file and
        notice that it contains two lists:
        <code>periods_that_start_with_a_day</code> and
        <code>periods_that_start_with_a_night</code>. You will use
        these two lists to test your program during this
        assignment.</div></li>

    <li><div>Use this code to begin your Python program
<pre>import test_periods
import weather_html

city_name = "Rexburg, Idaho"
periods = test_periods.periods_that_start_with_a_day
# periods = test_periods.periods_that_start_with_a_night</pre></div></li>

    <li><div><p>Finish your program by writing code to call the four
    functions from the <code>weather_html</code> module as necessary
    to produce an HTML document in a five day vertical format. Your
    program should also include if statements and loops as
    necessary. Here are two sample reports in a five day vertical
    format.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div><a target="_blank" href="forecast5day.html">forecast5day.html</a></div></li>
        <li><div><a target="_blank" href="forecast5night.html">forecast5night.html</a></div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>The first report is for a forecast that was retrieved early
    in a morning and therefore begins with a day period. The second
    report is for a forecast that was retrieved in an afternoon and
    therefore begins with a night period. The reports that your
    program creates should look like the sample
    reports.</p></div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each
    step in this testing procedure:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Run your program and double click on the HTML file
        that you program produces. Double clicking the HTML file
        should open it in a browser. Look at the document in the
        browser and verify that it looks like the forecast5day.html
        document.</div></li>

        <li><div>Change your program to use the list
        <code>periods_that_start_with_a_night</code> and then run
        your program again. Double click on the HTML file and verify
        that the document changed and that it looks like the
        forecast5night.html document.</div></li>
    </ol>
