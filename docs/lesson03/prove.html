    <h1>03 Prove Milestone: Writing Functions</h1>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write functions with parameters and call those
    functions with arguments.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Modern computers are capable of performing all sorts of
    calculations to produce numbers. However, they are also capable of
    performing calculations to produce art, illustrations, animations,
    movies, and music. Python includes a library of code named
    <code>tkinter</code> that enables a program to draw shapes in a
    computer window. You can write a program that calls the
    <code>tkinter</code> drawing functions to draw an illustration in a
    computer window.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>During this prove milestone and the next prove assignment, you
    will write a Python program that uses the <code>tkinter</code>
    library to draw a semi-realistic outdoor scene. Your program can
    draw any outdoor scene that you like as long as it meets these
    requirements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>The scene must be outdoor and include part of the
        sky.</div></li>
        <li><div>The sky must have clouds.</div></li>
        <li><div>The scene must include repetitive objects such as
        blades of grass, trees, leaves on a tree, birds, flowers,
        insects, fish, pickets in a fence, dashed lines on a road,
        buildings, bales of hay, snowmen, snowflakes, or
        icicles.</div></li>
        <li><div>Each of the objects in your scene should be drawn in
        its own function such as <code>draw_sky</code>,
        <code>draw_cloud</code>, <code>draw_ground</code>,
        <code>draw_flower</code>, <code>draw_fence</code>,
        <code>draw_fish</code>, etc.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>During this milestone, you will write code that draws the sky,
    the ground, and clouds in your scene. During the next lesson, you
    will write code that completes your scene. Be creative.</p>

    <p>The example scene below was drawn by a student's Python program
    and fulfills the requirements of this assignment.</p>

    <h3>Scene Gallery</h3>
    <p>If you would like ideas about what your program can draw, look at
    the scenes in <a href="../lesson04/gallery/index.html">this gallery</a>.
    All the scenes in the gallery were drawn by programs written by
    former CSE&nbsp;111 students.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Begin your program by copying and pasting the following code into
    a new file named <code>scene.py</code>. This beginning code imports
    the <code>tkinter</code> library and creates a window and a canvas
    that your program can draw to.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex1"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python">
import tkinter as tk


def main():
    # The width and height of the scene window.
    width = 800
    height = 500

    # Create the Tk root object.
    root = tk.Tk()
    root.geometry(f"{width}x{height}")

    # Create a Frame object.
    frame = tk.Frame(root)
    frame.master.title("Scene")
    frame.pack(fill=tk.BOTH, expand=1)

    # Create a canvas object that will draw into the frame.
    canvas = tk.Canvas(frame)
    canvas.pack(fill=tk.BOTH, expand=1)

    # Call the draw_scene function.
    draw_scene(canvas, 0, 0, width-1, height-1)

    root.mainloop()


def draw_scene(canvas, scene_left, scene_top, scene_right,scene_bottom):
    """Draw a scene in the canvas. scene_left, scene_top,
    scene_right, and scene_bottom contain the extent in
    pixels of the region where the scene should be drawn.

    Parameters
        scene_left: left side of the region; less than scene_right
        scene_top: top of the region; less than scene_bottom
        scene_right: right side of the region
        scene_bottom: bottom of the region
    Return: nothing

    If needed, the width and height of the
    region can be calculated like this:
    scene_width = scene_right - scene_left + 1
    scene_height = scene_bottom - scene_top + 1
    """
    # Call your functions here, such as draw_sky, draw_ground,
    # draw_snowman, draw_tree, draw_shrub, etc.
    tree_center = scene_left + 500
    tree_top = scene_top + 100
    tree_height = 150
    draw_pine_tree(canvas, tree_center, tree_top, tree_height)


# Define more functions here, like draw_sky, draw_ground,
# draw_cloud, draw_tree, draw_kite, draw_snowflake, etc.


def draw_pine_tree(canvas, peak_x, peak_y, height):
    """Draw a single pine tree.
    Parameters
        canvas: The tkinter canvas where this
            function will draw a pine tree.
        peak_x, peak_y: The x and y location in pixels where
            this function will draw the top peak of a pine tree.
        height: The height in pixels of the pine tree that
            this function will draw.
    Return: nothing
    """
    trunk_width = height / 10
    trunk_height = height / 8
    trunk_left = peak_x - trunk_width / 2
    trunk_right = peak_x + trunk_width / 2
    trunk_bottom = peak_y + height

    skirt_width = height / 2
    skirt_height = height - trunk_height
    skirt_left = peak_x - skirt_width / 2
    skirt_right = peak_x + skirt_width / 2
    skirt_bottom = peak_y + skirt_height

    # Draw the trunk of the pine tree.
    canvas.create_rectangle(trunk_left, skirt_bottom,
            trunk_right, trunk_bottom,
            outline="gray20", width=1, fill="tan3")

    # Draw the crown (also called skirt) of the pine tree.
    canvas.create_polygon(peak_x, peak_y,
            skirt_right, skirt_bottom,
            skirt_left, skirt_bottom,
            outline="gray20", width=1, fill="dark green")


# Call the main function so that
# this program will start executing.
main()</pre></div>

    <p>Save your new file as <code>scene.py</code> and run your new
    Python program. When you run it, it should open a window that
    contains a single pine tree as shown in the image below. The pine
    tree was drawn because of the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>The code at <span class="cross"
        data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;94</span> called the <code>main</code>
        function.</div></li>

        <li><div>At <span class="cross"
        data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;23</span>, the <code>main</code>
        function called the <code>draw_scene</code> function.</div></li>

        <li><div>At <span class="cross"
        data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;50</span>, the <code>draw_scene</code>
        function called the <code>draw_pine_tree</code>
        function.</div></li>

        <li><div>At <span class="cross"
        data-ref="ex1">lines&nbsp;81&ndash;89</span> the
        <code>draw_pine_tree</code> function called the
        <code>create_rectangle</code> and <code>create_polygon</code>
        methods.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Delete or comment-out lines&nbsp;47&ndash;50 and
    lines&nbsp;57&ndash;89 and begin writing your program. As you write
    your program, be sure that it draws objects in the order of farthest
    away to nearest. For example, you program should draw the blue sky
    first, then the ground, then clouds, then trees, then insects in the
    trees.</p>

    <h2>Intent</h2>
    <p>The intent of this assignment is not to train you to become a
    world-famous cloud artist. Instead, the intent is to teach you how
    to apply the following principles to a real programming problem:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Dividing a large program into parts (functions)</div></li>
        <li><div>Writing a function</div></li>
        <li><div>Deciding what needs to be a parameter in a function
        definition</div></li>
        <li><div>Calling a function with different argument values to
        produce different results</div></li>
        <li><div>Understanding how to separate the parts of a function
        that should stay the same and the parts that depend on
        parameters, in order to make the function as reusable as
        possible.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Your program must be divided into functions such as
    <code>draw_sky</code>, <code>draw_cloud</code>,
    <code>draw_ground</code>, <code>draw_bird</code>,
    <code>draw_grass_blade</code>, and <code>draw_insect</code>. The
    headers for the <code>draw_scene</code> and
    <code>draw_pine_tree</code> functions in the example code above are
    good examples for the headers of all your draw_* functions. Below
    are a few other examples of headers for functions that you might
    want to include in your program. However, these are simply examples,
    and you can change them in your program or even exclude them from
    your program.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
def draw_house(canvas, house_left, house_bottom):

def draw_bird(canvas, bird_center, bird_top):

def draw_pebble(canvas, pebble_left, pebble_top, pebble_radius):

def draw_picket(canvas, picket_left, picket_bottom):

def draw_grass_blade(canvas, blade_left, blade_top, blade_height):</pre></div>

    <p>The following call graph shows the functions for a former
    student's scene drawing program that was well-designed. From the
    call graph we see that the student divided his program into small
    functions (draw_sky, draw_ground, draw_sun, draw_cloud, etc.). We
    see that the <code>main</code> function calls the
    <code>draw_scene</code> function. The <code>draw_scene</code>
    function calls the <code>draw_sky</code> and
    <code>draw_ground</code> functions. The <code>draw_sky</code>
    function calls the <code>draw_sun</code>, <code>draw_cloud</code>,
    and <code>draw_bird</code> functions, and so on. This was a good
    design because each function was relatively small and performed just
    one task. Also, because his <code>draw_flower</code> function had
    parameters, he wrote multiple calls to the <code>draw_flower</code>
    function in his <code>draw_ground</code> function, which easily drew
    multiple flowers in his scene. His <code>draw_cloud</code>,
    <code>draw_bird</code>, and <code>draw_tree</code> functions also
    had parameters, and he wrote multiple calls to them as well, which
    easily drew multiple clouds, birds, and trees. This was a good
    design.</p>

    <div class="figure full">
        <img src="call_graph_prove.svg"
        alt="The call graph from a well-designed program that draws an outdoor scene"
        title="The call graph from a well-designed program that draws an outdoor scene">
        <div>The call graph for a well-designed program. Because the
        program was divided into small functions that each perform a
        single task, the program was well-designed.</div>
    </div>

    <p>The next call graph shows the functions for a different student's
    scene drawing program. Notice that the student didn't separate his
    program into small functions. Instead, he wrote all the
    code to draw an outdoor scene inside the <code>draw_scene</code>
    function. The scene his program drew looked nice and had the same
    number of objects as the scene drawn by the first student's
    well-designed program. However, the <code>draw_scene</code> function
    in the second student's program was very long, complex, and
    confusing. This was a poor design.</p>

    <div class="figure center" style="width:25em">
        <img src="call_graph_prove_bad.svg"
        alt="The call graph from a poorly designed program that draws an outdoor scene"
        title="The call graph from a poorly designed program that draws an outdoor scene">
        <div>The call graph for a poorly designed program. Because the
        program was not divided into small functions, the
        <code>draw_scene</code> function called the <code>tkinter</code>
        functions to draw all the objects in the scene. The
        <code>draw_scene</code> function was very long and
        confusing.</div>
    </div>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each
    step in this testing procedure:</p>

    <ol class="test">
        <li><div>Run your program and verify that it correctly opens a
        window and draws within that window an outdoor scene that
        contains at least the sky, clouds, and the ground.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>On or before the due date, return to I-Learn and report your
    progress on this milestone.</p>
