"""
Write a Python program named fitness.py that does the following:
1. Asks the user to enter four values:
    a. gender
    b. birthdate in this format: YYYY-MM-DD
    c. weight in US pounds
    d. height in US inches
2. Converts the weight from pounds to kilograms (1 lb = 0.45359237 kg).
3. Converts inches to centimeters (1 in = 2.54 cm).
4. Calculates age, BMI, and BMR.
5. Prints age, weight in kg, height in cm, BMI, and BMR.
