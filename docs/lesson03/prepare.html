    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn during this lesson:</p>

    <h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
    <p>Within a Python program, we can store many elements in a
    <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists">list</a>.
    Lists are mutable, meaning they can be changed after they are
    created. Each element in a list is stored at a unique index. An
    index is always an integer, and the first index in a Python list is
    always zero (0). The following diagram shows a list that contains
    five words. The diagram shows both the elements and the indexes of
    the list. Notice that each index is a unique integer, and that the
    first index is zero.</p>

    <table class="list center"><tbody>
        <tr class="elems"><td class="label">elements</td>
            <td>"yellow"</td> <td>"red"</td> <td>"green"</td>
            <td>"yellow"</td> <td>"blue"</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="label">indexes</td> <td>[0]</td> <td>[1]</td>
            <td>[2]</td> <td>[3]</td> <td>[4]</td></tr>
        <tr><td></td>
            <td colspan="5">&larr; list length is 5 &rarr;</td></tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p>In a Python program, we can create a list by using square
    brackets ([ and ]). We can add an item to a list by using the
    <code>insert</code> and <code>append</code> methods. We can find an
    item in a list using the <code>index</code> method. We can determine
    the number of items in a list by using the <code>len</code>
    function. We can retrieve an item from a list and replace an item in
    a list using square brackets ([ and ]) and an index. We can remove
    an item from a list using <code>del</code>, <code>pop</code>, and
    <code>remove</code>. The following code example shows how to create
    a list and add, find, and remove items from a list.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex1">
# Create a list that contains five words.
colors = ["yellow", "red", "green", "yellow", "blue"]

# Print the element that is stored
# at index 2 in the colors list.
print(colors[2])

# Print the entire colors list.
print(colors)


# Create an empty list that will hold fabric names.
fabrics = []

# Add three elements at the end of the fabrics list.
fabrics.append("velvet")
fabrics.append("denim")
fabrics.append("gingham")

# Insert an element at the beginning of the fabrics list.
fabrics.insert(0, "chiffon")

# Get the index where velvet is stored in the fabrics list.
i = fabrics.index("velvet")

# Replace velvet with taffeta.
fabrics[i] = "taffeta"

# Remove the last element from the fabrics list.
fabrics.pop()

# Remove taffeta from the fabrics list.
fabrics.remove("taffeta")

# Get the length of the fabrics list and print it.
n = len(fabrics)
print(f"The fabrics list contains {n} elements.")

# Use a for loop to print each element in the list. Of
# course, the code in the body of a loop can do much
# more with each element than simply print it.
for element in fabrics:
    print(element)</pre></div>

    <h3 id="dicts">Dictionaries</h3>
    <p>Within a Python program, we can store many items in a
    <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries">dictionary</a>.
    Dictionaries are mutable, meaning they can be changed after they are
    created. In a dictionary, items are stored as key value pairs. All
    keys within a dictionary must be unique. In other words, no key can
    appear more than once in a dictionary. Values within a dictionary do
    not have to be unique. The following table shows a dictionary that
    contains five items (five key value pairs) Notice that each of the
    keys is unique.</p>

    <table class="center"><thead>
        <tr><th colspan="2">items</th> <th></th></tr>
        <tr><th>keys</th> <th>values</th> <th></th></tr>
    </thead><tbody>
        <tr><td>42-039-4736</td> <td>Clint Huish</td>
            <td class="center">&uarr;</td></tr>
        <tr><td>61-315-0160</td> <td>Michelle Davis</td>
            <td class="center">5</td></tr>
        <tr><td>10-450-1203</td> <td>Jorge Soares</td>
            <td class="center">items</td></tr>
        <tr><td>75-421-2310</td> <td>Abdul Ali</td>
            <td class="center"></td></tr>
        <tr><td>07-103-5621</td> <td>Michelle Davis</td>
            <td class="center">&darr;</td></tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p>We can create a dictionary by using curly braces ({ and }). We
    can add an item to a dictionary and look up an item in a dictionary
    by using the square brackets ([ and ]) and a key. The following code
    example shows how to create a dictionary and add and look up items
    in a dictionary.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python" id="ex2">
# Create a dictionary with student IDs as
# the keys and student names as the values.
students = {
    "42-039-4736": "Clint Huish",
    "61-315-0160": "Michelle Davis",
    "10-450-1203": "Jorge Soares",
    "75-421-2310": "Abdul Ali",
    "07-103-5621": "Michelle Davis"
}

# Add an item to the dictionary.
<em>students["81-298-9238"] = "Sama Patel"</em>

# Get the number of items in the dictionary and print it.
n = len(students)
print(n)

# Print the entire dictionary.
print(students)

# Get a student ID from the user.
id = input("Enter a student ID: ")

# Check if the student ID is in the dictionary.
if id in students:
    # Lookup the student ID in the dictionary and
    # retrieve the corresponding student name.
    <em>name = students[id]</em>

    # Print the student name.
    print(name)
else:
    print("No such student")

# Use a for loop to print each key value pair in the
# dictionary. Of course, the code in the body of a loop can
# do much more with each key value pair than simply print it.
for key, value in students.items():
    print(key, value)</pre></div>

    <p><span class="cross" data-ref="ex2">Line&nbsp;12</span> in the
    previous code example, adds an item to the dictionary. To add an
    item to an existing dictionary, write code that follows this
    template:</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">dictionary_name[key] = value</pre></div>
    <p>Notice that line&nbsp;12 follows this template.</p>

    <p><span class="cross" data-ref="ex2">Line&nbsp;28</span> in the
    previous code example, looks up a key and retrieves its
    corresponding value from a dictionary. To look up a key and retrieve
    its corresponding value, write code that follows this template:</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">value = dictionary_name[key]</pre></div>
    <p>Notice that line&nbsp;28 follows this template.</p>

    <h3>Converting between Lists and Dictionaries</h3>
    <p>It is possible to convert two lists into a dictionary by using
    the built-in <code>zip</code> and <code>dict</code> functions. The
    contents of the first list will become the keys in the dictionary,
    and the contents of the second list will become the values. This
    implies that the two lists must have the same length, and the
    elements in the first list must be unique because keys in a
    dictionary must be unique.</p>

    <p>It is also possible to convert a dictionary into two lists by
    using the <code>keys</code> and <code>values</code> methods and the
    built-in <code>list</code> function. The following code example
    starts with two lists, converts them into a dictionary, and then
    converts the dictionary into two lists.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex3">
# Create a list that contains five student numbers.
numbers = ["42-039-4736", "61-315-0160",
        "10-450-1203", "75-421-2310", "07-103-5621"]

# Create a list that contains five student names.
names = ["Clint Huish", "Michelle Davis",
        "Jorge Soares", "Abdul Ali", "Michelle Davis"]

# Convert the numbers list and names list into a dictionary.
<em>student_dict = dict(zip(numbers, names))</em>

# Print the entire student dictionary.
print(student_dict)

# Convert the student dictionary into
# two lists named keys and values.
<em>keys = list(student_dict.keys())
values = list(student_dict.values())</em>

# Print both lists.
print(keys)
print(values)</pre></div>

    <h3 id="textFiles">Text Files</h3>
    <p>The built-in
    <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open"><code>open()</code></a>
    function opens a file for reading or writing. The
    <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects"><code>file.read()</code></a>
    method reads characters or bytes from a file. The
    <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.splitlines"><code>string.splitlines()</code></a>
    method breaks a string into a list of strings, breaking at line
    boundaries. The following code example uses the built-in
    <code>open</code> function and <code>file.read</code> and
    <code>string.splitlines</code> methods to read the contents of a
    text file into a list.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex4">
# Open the plants.txt file for reading.
with <em>open("plants.txt", "rt")</em> as infile:

    # Read all the characters in the file into a string.
    <em>string = infile.read()</em>

# Split the string into a list of strings named
# plants. Each line from the plants.txt file
# will be stored in its own element in the list.
<em>plants = string.splitlines()</em>

# Print the entire list.
print(plants)</pre></div>

    <h3 id="csvFiles">Comma Separated Values</h3>
    <p>Many computer systems import and export data in CSV files. CSV is
    an acronym for comma separated values. A CSV file is a text file
    that contains tabular data where each row is on a separate line and
    each cell (column) is separated by a comma. The following example is
    the contents of a CSV file that stores information about some dental
    offices in Rexburg, Idaho. Notice that the first row of the file
    contains column headings, the next four rows contain information
    about four dental offices, and each row contains three columns
    separated by commas.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="csv">
Company Name,Address,Phone Number
Eagle Rock Dental Care,556 Trejo Suite C,208-359-2224
Apple Tree Dental,33 Winn Drive Suite 2,208-359-1500
Rockhouse Dentistry,106 E 1st N,208-356-5600
Cornerstone Family Dental,44 S Center Street,208-356-4240
</pre></div>

    <p>Python has a module named <a target="_blank"
    href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html"><code>csv</code></a>
    that includes functionality to read and write data from CSV files.
    The following example code shows how to open a CSV file and use the
    <code>csv</code> module to read and print each row.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex5">
import csv

# Open a file named dentists.csv and store a reference
# to the opened file in a variable named infile.
with open("dentists.csv", "rt") as infile:

    # Use the csv module to create a reader
    # object that will read from the opened file.
    reader = csv.reader(infile)

    # The first line of the CSV file contains column headings
    # and not information about a dental office, so this
    # statement skips the first line of the CSV file.
    next(reader)

    # Read each row one at a time as a list.
    for row in reader:

        # For the current row, retrieve the
        # values in columns 0, 1, and 2.
        company = row[0]
        address = row[1]
        phone = row[2]

        # Print the values for the user to see.
        print(company, address, phone)</pre></div>

    <p>You could use this example code in a program that you write, but
    of course, you could modify the <code>for</code> loop in the code to
    do much more than simply print the contents of each row. For
    example, the next code sample shows how to read the contents of a
    CSV file into a dictionary.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex6">
import csv

# Create an empty dictionary that will
# store the data from the CSV file.
<em>dentists = {}</em>

# Open a file named dentists.csv and store a reference
# to the opened file in a variable named infile.
with open("dentists.csv", "rt") as infile:

    # Use the csv module to create a reader
    # object that will read from the opened file.
    reader = csv.reader(infile)

    # The first line of the CSV file contains column headings
    # and not information about a dental office, so this
    # statement skips the first line of the CSV file.
    next(reader)

    # Read each row one at a time as a list.
    for row in reader:

        # For the current row, retrieve the
        # values in columns 0, 1, and 2.
        company = row[0]
        address = row[1]
        phone = row[2]

        # Store the data from the current row into the dentists
        # dictionary. Use the phone number as the key. Create a
        # list with the company name and address as the value.
        <em>dentists[phone] = [company, address]</em>

# Print the entire dentists dictionary.
print(dentists)</pre></div>
