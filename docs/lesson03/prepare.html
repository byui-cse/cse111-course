    <h1>03 Prepare: Writing Functions</h1>
    <p>Because most useful computer programs are very large, programmers
    divide their programs into parts. Dividing a program into parts
    makes it easier to write, debug, and understand the program. A
    programmer can divide a Python program into modules, classes, and
    functions. In this lesson and the next, you will learn how to write
    your own functions.</p>

    <h2>Videos</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn during this lesson:</p>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>A <dfn>function</dfn> is a group of statements that
        together perform one task. Broadly speaking, there are four
        types of functions in Python which are:
        <ol>
            <li><div>Built-in functions</div></li>
            <li><div>Standard library functions</div></li>
            <li><div>Third-party functions</div></li>
            <li><div>User defined functions</div></li>
        </ol>
        In the previous lesson, you learned how to call the first two
        types of functions. In lesson&nbsp;5, you'll learn how to
        install third-party modules and call third-party functions. In
        this lesson, you'll learn how to write and call user defined
        functions.</div></li>

        <li><div>A <dfn>user-defined function</dfn> is a function that
        is not a built-in function, a standard function, or a
        third-party function. A user-defined function is written by a
        programmer like yourself as part of a program. For some students
        the term "user-defined function" is confusing because the user
        of a program does not define the function. Instead, the
        programmer (you) define user-defined functions. Perhaps a more
        correct term is programmer-defined function. Writing
        user-defined functions has several advantages, including:
        <ol>
            <li><div>User-defined functions make your code more
            reusable.</div></li>
            <li><div>User-defined functions make your code easier to
            understand and debug.</div></li>
            <li><div>User-defined functions make your code easier to
            change or add capabilities.</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>

        <li><div>To write a user-defined function in Python, simply type
        code that matches this template:

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
def <var>function_name</var>(<var>param1</var>, <var>param2</var>, &hellip; <var>paramN</var>):
    <var>statement1</var>
    <var>statement2</var>
        &vellip;
    <var>statementN</var>
    return <var>value</var></pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>The first line of a function is called the
        <dfn>header</dfn> or <dfn>signature</dfn>, and it includes the
        following:
        <ol>
            <li><div>the keyword <code>def</code> (which is an
            abbreviation for "define")</div></li>
            <li><div>the function name</div></li>
            <li><div>the parameter list (with the parameters separated
            by commas)</div></li>
        </ol>
        Here is the header for a function named <code>draw_circle</code>
        that takes three parameters named <code>x</code>,
        <code>y</code>, and <code>radius</code>:

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">def draw_circle(x, y, radius):</pre></div>

        You could read the previous line of code as, "Define a function
        named <code>draw_circle</code> that takes three
        parameters."</div></li>

        <li><div>The <dfn>function name</dfn> must start with a letter
        or the underscore (_). The rest of the name must be made of
        letters, digits (0â€“9), or the underscore. A function name cannot
        include spaces or other punctuation. A function name should be
        meaningful and should describe curtly what the function does.
        Well-named functions almost always start with a verb.</div></li>

        <li id="param"><div>The parameter list contains data stored in
        variables that the function needs to complete its task. A
        <dfn>parameter</dfn> is a variable whose value comes from
        outside the function. One way to get input into a function is to
        ask the user for input by calling the built-in Python
        <code>input</code> function. Another way to get input into a
        function is through the function's parameters. Getting input
        through parameters is much more flexible than asking the user
        for input because the input through parameters can come from the
        user or a file on a hard drive or the network or a sensor or
        even another function.</div></li>

        <li><div><p>The statements inside a function are called the
        <dfn>body</dfn> of the function. Just like other block
        statements, such as <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>,
        <code>while</code>, and <code>for</code>, all of which end with
        a colon (:), you must indent the statements inside the body of a
        function. The body of a function should begin with a
        <dfn>docstring</dfn> which is a triple quoted string that
        describes the function's purpose, parameters and return value.
        The body of a function may contain as many statements
        as you wish to write inside of it. However, it is a good idea to
        limit functions to less than 60 lines of text.</p>

        <p>Example&nbsp;1 contains a function named
        <code>print_cylinder_volume()</code> that gets two numbers from
        the user:&nbsp; <var>radius</var> and <var>height</var> and uses
        those numbers to compute the volume of a cylinder and then
        prints the volume for the user to see.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex1"># Example 1

import math

# Define a function named print_cylinder_volume.
def print_cylinder_volume():
    """Compute and print the volume of a cylinder."""

    # Get the radius and height from the user.
    radius = float(input("Please enter the radius of a cylinder: "))
    height = float(input("Please enter the height of a cylinder: "))

    # Compute the volume of the cylinder.
    volume = math.pi * radius**2 * height

    # Print the volume of the cylinder.
    print(volume)</pre></div>

    <p>Example&nbsp;2 contains another version of the
    <code>print_cylinder_volume</code> function. This second version
    doesn't get the radius and height from the user. Instead it accepts
    two parameters named <var>radius</var> and <var>height</var>.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex2"># Example 2

import math

# Define a function named print_cylinder_volume.
def print_cylinder_volume(<em>radius</em>, <em>height</em>):
    """Compute and print the volume of a cylinder.

    Parameters
        radius: the radius of the cylinder
        height: the height of the cylinder
    """
    # Compute the volume of the cylinder.
    volume = math.pi * radius**2 * height

    # Print the volume of the cylinder.
    print(volume)</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div><p>Many functions that you've used in the past such as
        <code>input</code>, <code>float</code>, and <code>round</code>,
        <dfn>return</dfn> a result. When a function returns a result, we
        usually store that result in a variable to use later like this:

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
text = input("Please enter your name: ")</pre></div>

        <p>To return a result from a function, simply type the keyword
        <code>return</code> followed by whatever result you want
        returned to the calling function. Example&nbsp;3 contains a
        third version of the cylinder volume function. Notice that this
        third version returns the volume instead of printing it, which
        makes the function more reusable. In this third version, we
        changed the name of the function from
        <code>print_cylinder_volume</code> to
        <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code> because this version
        doesn't print the volume but instead returns it.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex3"># Example 3

import math

# Define a function named computer_cylinder_volume.
def compute_cylinder_volume(radius, height):
    """Compute and return the volume of a cylinder.

    Parameters
        radius: the radius of the cylinder
        height: the height of the cylinder
    Return: the volume of the cylinder
    """
    # Compute the volume of the cylinder.
    volume = math.pi * radius**2 * height

    # Return the volume of the cylinder so that the
    # volume can be used somewhere else in the program.
    <em>return volume</em></pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>In all previous Python programs that you wrote in
        CSE&nbsp;110 and&nbsp;111, you wrote statements that were not in
        a function like the simple program in example&nbsp;4 where the
        statements are not inside the body of a function:

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex4"># Example 4

# Get a value in miles and convert it to kilometers.
miles = float(input("Please enter a distance in miles: "))
km = miles * 1.60934
print(f"{miles} miles is {km} kilometers")</pre></div>

        <p>However, writing statements outside of a function can lead to
        poor organization within a large program. Professional software
        developers write statements inside a function whenever possible.
        Beginning with this lesson, we will write nearly all statements
        inside a function. Also, each program will have a function named
        <code>main</code> which will contain the beginning statements of
        the program. In addition, we will have one or more functions
        that perform calculations and other useful work and return a
        value to the call point. Example&nbsp;5 contains a complete
        program that has a <code>main</code> function that calls the
        <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code> function:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python" id="ex5"># Example 5

# Define a function that accepts two parameters.
def compute_cylinder_volume(radius, height):
    """Compute and print the volume of a cylinder.

    Parameters
        radius: the radius of the cylinder
        height: the height of the cylinder
    Return: the volume of the cylinder
    """
    # Compute the volume of the cylinder.
    volume = math.pi * radius**2 * height

    # Return the volume of the cylinder so that the volume can
    # be used somewhere else in the program. The returned result
    # will be available wherever this function was called.
    return volume


# Define the main function.
def main():
    # Create two variables to hold the radius and height.
    r = float(input("Enter the radius in centimeters: "))
    h = float(input("Enter the height in centimeters: "))

    # Call the compute_cylinder_volume function and store
    # its return value in a variable to use later.
    <em>vol = compute_cylinder_volume(r, h)</em>

    if vol &lt; 1000:
        print(f"That cylinder holds {vol} cubic")
        print("centimeters, which is less than a liter.")
    else:
        print(f"That cylinder holds {vol} cubic")
        print("centimeters, which is a liter or more.")


# Start this program by
# calling the main function.
main()</pre></div>

        Notice the call to the <code>main</code> function at
        <span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">line&nbsp;41</span>
        in exmaple&nbsp;5. Without that call to the <code>main</code>
        function, when we run the program, the program would not do
        anything. All of your future programs in CSE&nbsp;111 will have
        a function named <code>main</code> and will have a call to
        <code>main</code> at the bottom of the program.</div></li>

        <li><div>While it's usually a good practice, you don't
        <em>have</em> to store the return value of a function in a
        variable. Sometimes you'll see it used directly as shown in
        example&nbsp;6.

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python" id="ex6"># Example 6

# Define the main function.
def main():
    # Create two variables to hold the radius and height.
    r = float(input("Enter the radius in centimeters: "))
    h = float(input("Enter the height in centimeters: "))

    # Call the compute_cylinder_volume function
    # and immediately print its return value.
    print( <em>compute_cylinder_volume(r, h)</em> )

    # Call the compute_cylinder_volume function again
    # and use its return value in an if statement.
    if <em>compute_cylinder_volume(r, h)</em> &lt; 1000:
        print("That cylinder holds less than a liter.")
    else:
        print("That cylinder holds a liter or more.")


# Start this program by
# calling the main function.
main()</pre></div>

        <p>Notice in the above example, we called the
        <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code> function twice, once at
        <span class="cross" data-ref="ex6">line&nbsp;11</span>
        to print the volume and again at
        <span class="cross" data-ref="ex6">line&nbsp;15</span>
        to check if the volume is less than a liter.Every time we call a
        function, the code inside the function body is executed. In the
        previous example, because the arguments are the same radius and
        height at both
        <span class="cross" data-ref="ex6">lines&nbsp;11 and&nbsp;15</span>,
        the result will be the same in both cases. So it would be faster
        to save the result in a variable and reuse the variable instead,
        as shown in example&nbsp;7.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python" id="ex7">#Example 7

# Define the main function.
def main():
    # Create two variables to hold the radius and height.
    r = float(input("Enter the radius in centimeters: "))
    h = float(input("Enter the height in centimeters: "))

    # Call the compute_cylinder_volume function and store
    # its return value in a variable to use later.
    <em>vol =</em> compute_cylinder_volume(r, h)

    print(f"The volume is: {<em>vol</em>}")

    if <em>vol</em> &lt; 1000:
        print("That cylinder holds less than a liter.")
    else:
        print("That cylinder holds a liter or more.")


# Start this program by
# calling the main function.
main()</pre></div></div></li>

        <li><div><p>Some students have trouble visualizing what happens
        when the computer calls (executes) a function. The following
        code example is a complete program that includes several
        function calls. The green arrows in the example code show how
        the computer executes statements in one location and then jumps
        to execute statements in another function. The blue arrows show
        how data flows from arguments into parameters and from a
        returned result to a variable. The circled numbers show the
        order in which the events happen in the computer.</p>

        <p>A computer will execute the statements in the previous
        example in this order:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><div>The statement at (1) is not inside of a function,
            so the computer executes it when the program begins. This is
            a call to the <code>main</code> function which causes the
            computer to begin executing the statements inside of
            <code>main</code> at (2).</div></li>
            <li><div>The computer gets three numbers from the
            user.</div></li>
            <li><div>The statement at (3) is a call to the
            <code>triangle_area</code> function.</div></li>
            <li><div>The computer copies the values in the arguments
            <var>side1</var>, <var>side2</var>, and <var>side3</var>
            into the parameters <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, and
            <var>c</var>, respectively and then begins executing the
            statements inside the <code>triangle_area</code> function at
            (5).</div></li>
            <li><div>The computer computes the area of a triangle.</div></li>
            <li><div>The statement at (6) is a return statement which
            causes the computer to stop executing the
            <code>triangle_area</code> function, to return a value to
            the call point at (3), and to resume executing statements at
            (8) after the call point.</div></li>
            <li><div>The computer returns the value in the
            <var>area</var> variable to the call point (3). At the call
            point, the returned value is stored in the
            <var>triarea</var> variable.</div></li>
            <li><div>The computer prints the value that is in the
            <var>triarea</var> variable for the user to see. This is the
            last statement in the <code>main</code> function, so after
            executing it, the computer resumes executing the statements
            after the call point (1) to main.</div></li>
            <li><div>There are no more statements after the call to
            <code>main</code>, so the program is finished.</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>

        <li><div>The most <dfn>reusable functions</dfn> are ones that
        take parameters, perform calculations, and return a value but
        <em>do not perform user input and output</em>. In the previous
        code example, there are two functions: <code>main</code> and
        <code>triangle_area</code>. The <code>main</code> function is
        certainly useful in this program, but it is not reusable in
        other programs because it gets user input and prints the result
        for the user to see. The <code>triangle_area</code> function is
        very reusable in another program because it doesn't get user
        input or print output. Instead it takes three parameters,
        performs a calculation, and returns a result to the calling
        function. This second function is so reusable that it could be
        included in a library of functions that compute the area and
        volume of 2-D and 3-D geometric shapes.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>It is extremely important that you can write and call
    functions.</strong> After watching the videos and reading the
    concepts related to writing a function, if the concepts still seem
    confusing or vague to you, watch the videos and read the list of
    concepts <strong>again</strong>.</p>
