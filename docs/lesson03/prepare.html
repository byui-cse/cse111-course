    <h1>03 Prepare: Writing Functions</h1>
    <p>Because most useful computer programs are very large, programmers
    divide their programs into parts. Dividing a program into parts
    makes it easier to write, debug, and understand the program. A
    programmer can divide a Python program into modules, classes, and
    functions. In this lesson and the next, you will learn how to write
    your own functions.</p>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn during this lesson.</p>

    <h3>What Is a Function?</h3>
    <p>A <dfn>function</dfn> is a group of statements that together
    perform one task. Broadly speaking, there are four types of
    functions in Python which are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Built-in functions</div></li>
        <li><div>Standard library functions</div></li>
        <li><div>Third-party functions</div></li>
        <li><div>User-defined functions</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>In the previous lesson, you learned how to call the first two
    types of functions. In lesson&nbsp;5, you will learn how to install
    third-party modules and call third-party functions. In this lesson,
    you will learn how to write and call user-defined
    functions.</p>

    <h3>What Is a User-Defined Function?</h3>
    <p>A <dfn>user-defined function</dfn> is a function that is not a
    built-in function, a standard function, or a third-party function. A
    user-defined function is written by a programmer like yourself as
    part of a program. For some students the term "user-defined
    function" is confusing because the user of a program doesn't define
    the function. Instead, the programmer (you) define user-defined
    functions. Perhaps a more correct term is programmer-defined
    function. Writing user-defined functions has several advantages,
    including:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>making your code more reusable</div></li>
        <li><div>making your code easier to understand and debug</div></li>
        <li><div>making your code easier to change and add
        capabilities</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>How to Write a User-Defined Function</h3>
    <p>To write a user-defined function in Python, simply type code
    that matches this template:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
def <var>function_name</var>(<var>param1</var>, <var>param2</var>, &hellip; <var>paramN</var>):
    """<var>documentation string</var>"""
    <var>statement1</var>
    <var>statement2</var>
        &vellip;
    <var>statementN</var>
    return <var>value</var></pre></div>

    <p>The first line of a function is called the <dfn>header</dfn> or
    <dfn>signature</dfn>, and it includes the following:
    <ol>
        <li><div>the keyword <code>def</code> (which is an
        abbreviation for "define")</div></li>
        <li><div>the function name</div></li>
        <li><div>the parameter list (with the parameters separated
        by commas)</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Here is the header for a function named <code>draw_circle</code>
    that takes three parameters named <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>,
    and <code>radius</code>:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">def draw_circle(x, y, radius):</pre></div>

    <p>You could read the previous line of code as, "Define a function
    named <code>draw_circle</code> that takes three parameters named
    <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, and <var>radius</var>."</p>

    <p>The <dfn>function name</dfn> must start with a letter or the
    underscore (_). The rest of the name must be made of letters, digits
    (0â€“9), or the underscore. A function name cannot include spaces or
    other punctuation. A function name should be meaningful and should
    describe briefly what the function does. Well-named functions often
    start with a verb.</p>

    <p>The statements inside a function are called the <dfn>body</dfn>
    of the function. Just like other block statements, such as
    <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>while</code>, and
    <code>for</code>, all of which end with a colon (:), you must indent
    the statements inside the body of a function. The body of a function
    should begin with a <dfn>documentation string</dfn> which is a
    triple quoted string that describes the function's purpose,
    parameters and return value. The body of a function may contain as
    many statements as you wish to write inside of it. However, it is a
    good idea to limit functions to less than 20 lines of code.</p>

    <div class="figure right" style="width:11em">
        <img src="cylinder.png"
        alt="Diagram of a right circular cylinder with radius r and height h"
        title="Diagram of a right circular cylinder with radius r and height h">
        <div>A right circular cylinder with radius <var>r</var> and height
        <var>h</var></div>
    </div>
    <p>Example&nbsp;1 contains a function named
    <code>print_cylinder_volume()</code> with no parameters that gets
    two numbers from the user:&nbsp; <var>radius</var> and
    <var>height</var> and uses those numbers to compute the volume of a
    right circular cylinder and then prints the volume for the user to
    see.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex1">
<pre class="python"># Example 1

import math

# Define a function named print_cylinder_volume.
def print_cylinder_volume():
    """Compute and print the volume of a cylinder.
    Parameters: none
    Return: nothing
    """
    # Get the radius and height from the user.
    radius = float(input("Enter the radius of a cylinder: "))
    height = float(input("Enter the height of a cylinder: "))

    # Compute the volume of the cylinder.
    volume = math.pi * radius**2 * height

    # Print the volume of the cylinder.
    print(f"Volume: {volume:.2f}")</pre></div>

    <p>Because the <code>print_cylinder_volume</code> function in
    example&nbsp;1 doesn't accept parameters, it must be called without
    any arguments like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">    print_cylinder_volume()</pre></div>

    <h3>How to Make a User-Defined Function Reusable</h3>
    <p>Because the <code>print_cylinder_volume</code> function in
    example&nbsp;1 gets input from a user and prints its results to a
    terminal window, it can be used only in a program that runs when a
    user is present. It cannot be used in a program that runs
    automatically and gets input from a file or the network or a sensor.
    In other words, the <code>print_cylinder_volume</code> function in
    example&nbsp;1 is not reusable in other programs. The most
    <dfn>reusable functions</dfn> are ones that take parameters, perform
    calculations, and return a value but <em>do not perform user input
    and output</em>.</p>

    <p id="param">The parameter list in a function's header contains
    data stored in variables that the function needs to complete its
    task. A <dfn>parameter</dfn> is a variable whose value comes from
    outside the function. One way to get input into a function is to ask
    the user for input by calling the built-in Python <code>input</code>
    function. Another way to get input into a function is through the
    function's parameters. Getting input through parameters is much more
    flexible than asking the user for input because the input through
    parameters can come from the user or a file on a hard drive or the
    network or a sensor or even another function.</p>

    <p>Example&nbsp;2 contains another version of the
    <code>print_cylinder_volume</code> function. This second version
    doesn't get the radius and height from the user. Instead, it gets
    input through its two parameters named <var>radius</var> and
    <var>height</var>.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex2">
<pre class="python"># Example 2

import math

# Define a function named print_cylinder_volume.
def print_cylinder_volume(<em>radius</em>, <em>height</em>):
    """Compute and print the volume of a cylinder.
    Parameters
        radius: the radius of the cylinder
        height: the height of the cylinder
    Return: nothing
    """
    # Compute the volume of the cylinder.
    volume = math.pi * radius**2 * height

    # Print the volume of the cylinder.
    print(volume)</pre></div>

    <p>Because the second version of <code>print_cylinder_volume</code>
    function accepts two parameters, it must be called with two
    arguments like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">    print_cylinder_volume(2.5, 4.1)</pre></div>

    <p>To <dfn>return</dfn> a result from a function, simply type the
    keyword <code>return</code> followed by whatever result you want
    returned to the calling function. Example&nbsp;3 contains a third
    version of the cylinder volume function. Notice that the version in
    example&nbsp;3 returns the volume instead of printing it, which
    makes the function more reusable. Notice also in example&nbsp;3 that
    we changed the name of the function from
    <code>print_cylinder_volume</code> to
    <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code> because this version doesn't
    print the volume but instead returns it.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex3">
<pre class="python"># Example 3

import math

# Define a function named computer_cylinder_volume.
def compute_cylinder_volume(radius, height):
    """Compute and return the volume of a cylinder.
    Parameters
        radius: the radius of the cylinder
        height: the height of the cylinder
    Return: the volume of the cylinder
    """
    # Compute the volume of the cylinder.
    volume = math.pi * radius**2 * height

    # Return the volume of the cylinder so that the
    # volume can be used somewhere else in the program.
    <em>return volume</em></pre></div>

    <p>Many functions that you've used in the past such as
    <code>input</code>, <code>float</code>, and <code>round</code>,
    return a result. When a function returns a result, we usually write
    code to store that returned result in a variable to use later in the
    program like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">    <em>text =</em> input("Please enter your name: ")</pre></div>

    <p>Because the <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code> function in
    example&nbsp;3 accepts two parameters and returns a value, it
    could be called like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">     volume = compute_cylinder_volume(2.5, 4.1)</pre></div>

    <h3>The <code>main</code> User-Defined Function</h3>
    <p>In all previous Python programs that you wrote in CSE&nbsp;110
    and&nbsp;111, you wrote statements that were not in a function like
    the simple program in example&nbsp;4.

<div class="pre" id="ex4"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 4

import math

# Get the radius and height from the user.
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of a cylinder: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height of a cylinder: "))

# Compute the volume of the cylinder.
volume = math.pi * radius**2 * height

# Print the volume of the cylinder.
print(f"Volume: {volume:.2f}")</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="ex4">&gt; python example_4.py
Enter the radius in centimeters: <span class="input">3</span>
Enter the height in centimeters: <span class="input">8</span>
Volume: 226.19</pre>

    <p>Writing statements outside a function can lead to poor
    organization within a large program. Professional software
    developers write statements inside a function whenever possible.
    Beginning with this lesson, we will write nearly all statements
    inside a user-defined function. Also, each program will have a
    user-defined function named <code>main</code> which will contain the
    beginning statements of the program. In addition, each program will
    have one or more user-defined functions that perform calculations
    and other useful work and return a value to the call point.
    Example&nbsp;5 contains the same Python program as example&nbsp;4
    except most of the statements are inside a user-defined function
    named <code>main</code>.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex5"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 5

import math

# Define a function named main.
def main():
    # Get the radius and height from the user.
    radius = float(input("Enter the radius of a cylinder: "))
    height = float(input("Enter the height of a cylinder: "))

    # Compute the volume of the cylinder.
    volume = math.pi * radius**2 * height

    # Print the volume of the cylinder.
    print(f"Volume: {volume:.2f}")

# Start this program by
# calling the main function.
main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="ex5">&gt; python example_5.py
Enter the radius in centimeters: <span class="input">3</span>
Enter the height in centimeters: <span class="input">8</span>
Volume: 226.19</pre>

    <p>Notice the call to the <code>main</code> function at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">line&nbsp;19</span> in
    example&nbsp;5. Without that call to the <code>main</code> function,
    when we run the program, the program will not do anything. All of
    your future programs in CSE&nbsp;111 will have a user-defined
    function named <code>main</code> and will have a call to
    <code>main</code> at the bottom of the program.</p>

    <h3>A Complete Program with User-Defined Functions</h3>
    <p>If you look closely at the code in examples&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;5,
    you will realize that both programs have the same problem, namely
    both the <code>print_cylinder_volume</code> function in
    example&nbsp;1 and the <code>main</code> function in example&nbsp;5
    are not reusable because both of them get input from a user and
    print to a terminal window. A better way to write the program in
    examples&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;5 is to separate the program into two
    functions, one named <code>main</code> and one named
    <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code> as shown in example&nbsp;6.

    <p>Example&nbsp;6 contains a complete program with two functions,
    the first named <code>main</code>
    at <span class="cross" data-ref="ex6">line&nbsp;6</span> and the
    second named <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code>
    at <span class="cross" data-ref="ex6">line&nbsp;20</span>.
    At <span class="cross" data-ref="ex6">line&nbsp;13</span>,
    the <code>main</code> function calls the
    <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code> function. Notice that the
    <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code> function gets its input through
    parameters and returns a value which makes this function reusable in
    other programs, including programs that run without a user.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex6"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 6

import math

# Define the main function.
def main():
    # Get a radius and a height from the user.
    radius = float(input("Enter the radius of a cylinder: "))
    height = float(input("Enter the height of a cylinder: "))

    # Call the compute_cylinder_volume function and store
    # its return value in a variable to use later.
    <em>volume = compute_cylinder_volume(radius, height)</em>

    # Print the volume of the cylinder.
    print(f"Volume: {volume:.2f}")


# Define a function that accepts two parameters.
def compute_cylinder_volume(radius, height):
    """Compute and print the volume of a cylinder.
    Parameters
        radius: the radius of the cylinder
        height: the height of the cylinder
    Return: the volume of the cylinder
    """
    # Compute the volume of the cylinder.
    volume = math.pi * radius**2 * height

    # Return the volume of the cylinder so that the
    # volume can be used somewhere else in the program.
    # The returned result will be available wherever
    # this function was called.
    return volume


# Start this program by
# calling the main function.
main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="ex6">&gt; python example_6.py
Enter the radius in centimeters: <span class="input">3</span>
Enter the height in centimeters: <span class="input">8</span>
Volume: 226.19</pre>

    <p>The most reusable functions are ones that take parameters,
    perform calculations, and return a value but <em>do not perform user
    input and output</em>. In the previous code example, there are two
    functions: <code>main</code> and
    <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code>. The <code>main</code> function
    is certainly useful in the program, but it is not reusable in other
    programs because it gets user input and prints the result for the
    user to see. The <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code> function is
    very reusable in another program because it doesn't get user input
    or print output. Instead, it takes two parameters, performs a
    calculation, and returns the result to the calling function. The
    <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code> function is so reusable that it
    could be included in a library of functions that compute the area
    and volume of 2-D and 3-D geometric shapes.</p>

    <h3>What Happens When the Computer Calls a Function?</h3>
    <p>Some students have trouble visualizing what happens when the
    computer calls (executes) a function. The following diagram contains
    the same program as example&nbsp;6. The circled numbers show the
    order in which the events happen in the computer. The green arrows
    in the diagram show how the computer executes statements in one
    location. Then when a function is called, the computer jumps to
    execute statements in the called function. The blue arrows show how
    data flows from arguments into parameters and from a returned result
    to a variable.</p>

    <div class="figure code" style="width:35em">
    <img src="call.svg"
    alt="A diagram showing a call to a function and a value returned from that function"
    title="A diagram showing a call to a function and a value returned from that function">
    </div>

    <p>A computer will execute the statements in the previous diagram in
    the following order:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha">
        <li><div>The statement at (1) is not inside a function, so
        the computer executes it when the program begins. The
        statement at (1) is a call to the <code>main</code> function
        which causes the computer to begin executing the statements
        inside <code>main</code> at (2).</div></li>

        <li><div>At (2), the computer gets two numbers from the
        user.</div></li>

        <li><div>The statement at (3) is a call to the
        <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code> function which causes the
        computer to copy the values in the arguments <var>r</var> and
        <var>h</var> into the parameters <var>radius</var> and
        <var>height</var> respectively and then begin executing the
        statements inside the <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code>
        function at (5).</div></li>

        <li><div>At (5), the computer computes the volume of a
        cylinder.</div></li>

        <li><div>The statement at (6) is a return statement which causes
        the computer to stop executing the
        <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code> function, to return the
        computed volume to the call point at (3), and to resume
        executing statements at the call point.</div></li>

        <li><div>At the call point (3), the computer stores the returned
        value in the variable named <var>v</var>.</div></li>

        <li><div>At (8), the computer prints the value that is in the
        <var>volume</var> variable for the user to see. This is the last
        statement in the <code>main</code> function, so after executing
        it, the computer resumes executing the statements after the call
        point (1) to <code>main</code>.</div></li>

        <li><div>At (9), there are no more statements after the call to
        <code>main</code>, so the computer terminates the
        program.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Call Graphs</h3>
    <div class="figure right" style="width:20em">
        <img src="call_graph_key.svg"
        alt="The key for reading call graphs"
        title="The key for reading call graphs">
    </div>
    <p>A <dfn>call graph</dfn> is a diagram that shows function calls
    and returns within a program. A call graph can help you visualize
    how a program is divided into functions. Within a call graph, the
    unfilled circle shows where the computer begins executing the
    program. A rounded rectangle represents a function. A solid arrow
    represents a call from one function to another function. A dashed
    arrow represents a value returned from a called function to the
    calling function.</p>

    <p>The call graph below shows the function calls and returns for the
    program in example&nbsp;6. From the call graph, we see that the
    computer begins executing the program by calling the
    <code>main</code> function. While executing the <code>main</code>
    function, the computer calls the <code>input</code> and
    <code>float</code> functions. Then the computer calls the
    <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code> function. Finally the computer
    calls the <code>print</code> function. In the call graph we can see
    that the <code>print</code> function doesn't return a value. The
    <code>print</code> function prints results for the user to see, but
    it doesn't return anything.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>A function is a group of statements that together perform one
    task. A user-defined function is a function written by a programmer
    like you. To write a user-defined function, write code that follows
    this template:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
def <var>function_name</var>(<var>param1</var>, <var>param2</var>, &hellip; <var>paramN</var>):
    """<var>documentation string</var>"""
    <var>statement1</var>
    <var>statement2</var>
        &vellip;
    <var>statementN</var>
    return <var>value</var></pre></div>

    <p>To call a user-defined function, write code that follows this
    template:</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="python"><var>variable_name</var> = <var>function_name</var>(<var>arg1</var>, <var>arg2</var>, &hellip; <var>argN</var>)</pre></div>

    <p>The most reusable functions are ones that take parameters,
    perform calculations, and return a value but <em>do not perform user
    input and output</em>. All of your future programs in CSE&nbsp;111
    will have a user-defined function named <code>main</code> and will
    have a call to <code>main</code> at the bottom of the program.</p>

    <p><strong>It is extremely important that you can write and call
    functions.</strong> After watching the videos and reading the
    concepts related to writing a function, if the concepts still seem
    confusing or vague to you, watch the videos and read the list of
    concepts <strong>again</strong>.</p>
