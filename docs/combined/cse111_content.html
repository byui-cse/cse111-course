    <h1>CSE 111 Syllabus</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>CSE&nbsp;111 students become more organized, efficient, and
    powerful computer programmers by learning to research and call
    functions written by others; to write, call, debug, and test their
    own functions; and to handle errors within functions. CSE&nbsp;111
    students write programs with functions to solve problems in many
    disciplines, including business, physical science, human
    performance, and humanities.</p>

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>Before beginning CSE&nbsp;111, you must successfully complete one
    of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>CSE 110 - Programming Building Blocks (2)</div></li>
        <li><div>CS 101 - Introduction to Programming (2)</div></li>
        <li><div>CIT 160 - Introduction to Programming (3)</div></li>
        <li><div>A minimum score of 170 on the LUC test</div></li>
        <li><div>Pathway Connect</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
    <p>Successful graduates of CSE&nbsp;111 will do the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Write and call functions in programs to accomplish
        meaningful tasks in a variety of domains</div></li>
        <li><div>Research and call functions written by others</div></li>
        <li><div>Write programs that can detect and recover from invalid
        conditions</div></li>
        <li><div>Use libraries and objects written by others</div></li>
        <li><div>Follow good practices in designing, writing, and
        debugging functions</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Topics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><div>functions, parameters, default parameter values,
        return, arguments, named arguments</div></li>
        <li><div>lambda functions</div></li>
        <li><div>lists, dictionaries</div></li>
        <li><div>text files, CSV files, csv Reader</div></li>
        <li><div>testing using pytest</div></li>
        <li><div>exception handling</div></li>
        <li><div>tkinter</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Textbook</h2>
    <p>There is no textbook for this course. Instead, I-Learn contains
    links to videos and web pages with the preparation material students
    will need.</p>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>In this course, you will use Python 3 and Visual Studio Code (VS
    Code). These applications are free and available for Windows, MacOS,
    and Linux. Each student must have a laptop or desktop computer that
    can run these applications.</p>

    <p>Students will use Microsoft Teams for communication about the
    course and I-Learn to submit assignments and quizzes.</p>

    <h2>Organization</h2>
    <p>This course is organized into a series of lessons. In the
    semester version of this course, students will complete one lesson
    each week. In the block version of this course, students will
    complete two lessons each week.</p>

    <p>Each lesson is organized as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>Prepare: Content&mdash;Articles and videos that each
        student should read and watch before beginning the other
        activities in the lesson.</div></li>

        <li><div>Prepare: Checkpoint&mdash;A small individual
        programming assignment designed to help each student practice
        the concepts taught in the prepare content.</div></li>

        <li><div>Teach: Team Activity&mdash;A one-hour programming
        activity that students will complete in groups of 3&ndash;5
        students. Campus students will complete this activity during
        class. Online students will complete this activity during a
        synchronous video conference that they arrange.</div></li>

        <li><div>Prove: Programming Assignment&mdash;An individual
        programming project. Most of these span two lessons, with a
        milestone deliverable due at the end of the first
        lesson.</div></li>

        <li><div>Ponder: Check your understanding&mdash;Every other
        lesson includes a multiple-choice quiz to help students check
        their understanding of the topic.</div></li>

        <li><div>Ponder: Reflection&mdash;Every other lesson will contain a
        two question quiz to allow students to reflect on the things
        they are learning.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Learning Model</h2>
    <p>We encourage you to learn by study and also by faith
    <a href="https://abn.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.118?lang=eng#p117">D&amp;C 88:118</a>).</p>

    <p>The three processes (prepare, teach one another, ponder and
    prove) of the BYU-Idaho
    <a href="http://www.byui.edu/learning-model">Learning Model</a> will
    help you deepen your learning experience. In this course, the
    Prepare phase of the Learning Model is delivered through the prepare
    content (articles and videos). The Teach One Another phase is
    facilitated through the team activities. The Ponder and Prove phase
    is measured through the weekly prove assignment.</p>

    <p>The Five Principles (exercise faith; teach by the Spirit; lay
    hold on the word of God; take action; and love, serve, and teach) of
    the learning model is where you, the student, can take personal
    responsibility and invite the Spirit to be part of your study and
    learning process.</p>

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <p>Each assignment in this course fits into one of five groups. Each
    group of assignments will contribute to your final grade according
    to the following percentages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>15%&mdash;Checkpoints</div></li>
        <li><div>20%&mdash;Team Activities</div></li>
        <li><div>50%&mdash;Prove Assignments</div></li>
        <li><div>10%&mdash;Check Your Understanding</div></li>
        <li><div>5%&mdash;Reflections</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Prove Assignments will be graded in broad categories according to
    the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>0%&mdash;Nothing submitted</div></li>
        <li><div>50%&mdash;Some attempt made</div></li>
        <li><div>75%&mdash;Developing (but significantly deficient)</div></li>
        <li><div>85%&mdash;Slightly deficient</div></li>
        <li><div>93%&mdash;Meets requirements</div></li>
        <li><div>100%&mdash;Shows creativity and exceeds requirements.
        This will be explained in the individual assignments, but there
        is an expectation to show creativity and extend your assignments
        beyond the minimum standard that is specifically
        required.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Letter grades will be awarded as follows:</p>

    <h2>Late Work</h2>
    <p>For all assignments, there is a 10% penalty for each day that has
    passed since the due date, up to a maximum of 50% penalty for any
    given assignment. This means that you can earn partial credit for
    assignments that you submit after the due date. Extenuating
    circumstances should be discussed with the instructor prior to the
    assignment due date.</p>

    <h2>Student Support</h2>
    <p>Support is available in many ways including via other class
    members and discussion in Microsoft Teams. In addition, help is
    available through the university's
    <a href="https://www.byui.edu/academic-support-centers">academic
    support center</a>.</p>

    <h2>BYU-Idaho Policies</h2>
    <h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
    <p>You are expected to follow the university's
    <a href="https://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/#academic-honesty">policies for academic honesty</a>.</p>

    <p>You may work with your classmates, but you must submit your own
    work for all assignments. Share ideas with your classmates; do not
    share code! Assistance from a classmate should be on par with the
    help students would expect from a lab assistant.</p>

    <p>If you work closely with another student, helping teach and learn
    from each other, make sure you each write your own code, but in this
    case, your solutions may end up being very similar. This is fine,
    but please make sure to put a comment in your code stating that you
    wrote your own program, but worked closely with that person, and
    that is why they are similar.</p>

    <p>We encourage you to use the Internet as a resource, but you
    should not copy and paste someone else's work as your own. Cite all
    sources and follow copyright laws. <strong>When in doubt, give
    credit and be upfront</strong>.</p>

    <p>Do not look for or share solutions on "note sharing" internet
    sites.</p>

    <p>The penalty for copying or plagiarism of assignments might be one
    or more of the following: a score of zero (0) on an assignment, a
    failing grade in the class, being asked to withdraw from the class,
    or disciplinary action by the University.</p>

    <h3>Dress and Grooming</h3>
    <p>Students are expected to follow the university's
    <a href="https://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/#dress-and-grooming-standards">Dress and Grooming Standards</a></p>

    <h3>Academic Grievances</h3>
    <p>If you have a concern about your course, we encourage you to
    contact your instructor. If your concern cannot be resolved in this
    way, you may contact the
    <a href="https://www.byui.edu/contact-us">BYU-Idaho Support Center</a>
    to formally register a concern or grievance. You can read more in the
    <a href="https://www.byui.edu/9-student-online-grievance-policy">Student
    Grievance Policy</a>.</p>

    <h3>Preventing Sexual Misconduct</h3>
    <p>BYU-Idaho prohibits sex discrimination by its employees and
    students in all of its education programs or activities. This
    includes all forms of sexual harassment, such as sexual assault,
    dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, conditioning a grade
    or job on participation in sexual conduct, and other forms of
    unwelcome sexual conduct.</p>

    <p>As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a
    safe learning environment for my students and for the campus as a
    whole. University policy requires deans and department chairs, and
    encourages all faculty, to report every incident of sexual
    harassment that comes to their attention. If you encounter or
    experience sexual harassment, please contact the Title IX
    Coordinator at <a href="mailto:titleix@byui.edu">titleix@byui.edu</a>

    <h1>01 Prepare: Review Python</h1>
    <p>The concepts in CSE&nbsp;111 build on the concepts that you
    learned in
    <a title="CSE 1110 Content" href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse110-course/index.html">CSE&nbsp;110</a>.
    In order to be successful in CSE&nbsp;111, it is important that you
    remember and understand the concepts from CSE&nbsp;110. To help you
    remember those concepts, during lesson&nbsp;1 of CSE&nbsp;111, you
    will review programming concepts that you learned in
    CSE&nbsp;110.</p>

    <h2 id="l01_prepare_concepts">Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here is a list of the Python programming concepts and topics from
    CSE&nbsp;110 that you should review during this lesson.</p>

    <h3 id="l01_prepare_comments">Comments</h3>
    <p>A <dfn>comment</dfn> in a computer program is a note or
    description that is supposed to help a programmer understand the
    program. Computers ignore comments in a program. In Python, a
    comment begins with the hash symbol (#) and extends to the end of
    the current line.</p>

    <h3 id="l01_prepare_user_input">User Input</h3>
    <p>In a Python program, we use the
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input"><code>input()</code> function</a>
    to get input from a user in a terminal window. The
    <code>input</code> function always returns a string of
    characters.</p>

    <h3 id="l01_prepare_variables">Variables</h3>
    <p>A <dfn>variable</dfn> is a location in a computer's memory where
    a program stores a value. A variable has a name, a data type, and a
    value. In Python, we assign a value to a variable by using the
    assignment operator, which is the equals symbol (=). A computer may
    change the value and data type of a variable while executing a
    program.</p>

    <h3 id="l01_prepare_data_types">Data Types</h3>
    <p>Python has many <dfn>data types</dfn> including <code>str</code>,
    <code>bool</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>,
    <code>list</code>, and <code>dict</code>. Most of the data types
    that you will use in your programs in CSE&nbsp;111 are shown in the
    following list.</p>

    <ul class="long">
        <li><div>A <dfn>str</dfn> (string) is any text inside single or
        double quotes, any text that a user enters, and any text in a
        text file. For example:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
greet = "Hello"
text = "23"
color = input("What is your favorite color? ")
</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>A <dfn>bool</dfn> (Boolean variable) is a variable that
        stores either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. A Boolean
        variable may not store any other value besides <code>True</code>
        or <code>False</code>. For example:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
found = True
</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>An <dfn>int</dfn> (integer) is a whole number like 14.
        An <code>int</code> may not have a fractional part or digits
        after the decimal point. For example:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
x = 14
</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>A <dfn>float</dfn> (floating point number) is a number
        that may have a fractional part or digits after the decimal
        point like 7.51. For example:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
sample = 7.51
</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>A <dfn>list</dfn> is a collection of values. Each value
        in a list is called an element and is stored at a unique index.
        The primary purpose of a list is to efficiently store many
        elements. In a Python program, we can create a list by using
        square brackets ([&nbsp;and&nbsp;]) and separating the elements
        with commas (,). For example here are two lists named
        <code>colors</code> and <code>samples</code>:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
colors = ["yellow", "red", "green", "yellow", "blue"]
samples = [6.5, 7.2, 7.0, 8.1, 7.2, 6.8, 6.8]
</pre></div>
        You will study lists in lesson&nbsp;7 of this course.</div></li>

        <li><div>A <dfn>dict</dfn> (dictionary) is a collection of
        items. Each item is a key value pair. The primary purpose of a
        dictionary is to enable a computer to find items very quickly.
        In a Python program, we can create a dictionary by using curly
        braces ({&nbsp;and&nbsp;}) and separating the items with commas
        (,). For example:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
students = {
    "42-039-4736": "Clint Huish",
    "61-315-0160": "Amelia Davis",
    "10-450-1203": "Ana Soares",
    "75-421-2310": "Abdul Ali",
    "07-103-5621": "Amelia Davis"
}</pre></div>
        You will study dictionaries in lesson&nbsp;8 of this
        course.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>It is possible to convert between many of the data types. For
    example, to convert from any data type to a string, we use the
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str"><code>str()</code> function</a>.
    To convert from a string to an integer, we use the
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int"><code>int()</code> function</a>,
    and to convert from a string to a float, we use the
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float"><code>float()</code> function</a>.
    The <code>int()</code> and <code>float()</code> functions are
    especially useful to convert user input, which is always a string,
    to a number. See the program in <a href="#ex2">example&nbsp;2</a>
    below.</p>

    <h3 id="l01_prepare_print">Displaying Results</h3>
    <p>In a Python program, we use the
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print"><code>print()</code></a>
    function to display results to a user. The easiest way to print both
    text and numbers together is to use a
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#formatted-string-literals">formatted string literal</a>
    (also known as an f-string).</p>

    <p>The Python program in example&nbsp;1 creates ten different
    variables. Some of the variables are of type <code>str</code>, some
    are of type <code>bool</code>, some of type <code>int</code>,
    and some of type <code>float</code>. The program uses f-strings
    to print the name, data type, and value of each variable.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l01_prepare_ex1"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 1

# Create variables of different data types and then
# print the variable names, data types, and values.

a = "Her name is "  # string
b = "Isabella"      # string
c = a + b           # string plus string makes string
print(f"a: {type(a)} {a}")
print(f"b: {type(b)} {b}")
print(f"c: {type(c)} {c}")
print()

d = False  # boolean
e = True   # boolean
print(f"d: {type(d)} {d}")
print(f"e: {type(e)} {e}")
print()

f = 15     # int
g = 7.62   # float
h = f + g  # int plus float makes float
print(f"f: {type(f)} {f}")
print(f"g: {type(g)} {g}")
print(f"h: {type(h)} {h}")
print()

i = "True"   # string because of the surrounding quotes
j = "2.718"  # string because of the surrounding quotes
print(f"i: {type(i)} {i}")
print(f"j: {type(j)} {j}")</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="l01_prepare_ex1">&gt; python example_1.py
a: &lt;class 'str'&gt; Her name is
b: &lt;class 'str'&gt; Isabella
c: &lt;class 'str'&gt; Her name is Isabella

d: &lt;class 'bool'&gt; False
e: &lt;class 'bool'&gt; True

f: &lt;class 'int'&gt; 15
g: &lt;class 'float'&gt; 7.62
h: &lt;class 'float'&gt; 22.62

i: &lt;class 'str'&gt; True
j: &lt;class 'str'&gt; 2.718</pre>

    <p>The Python program in example&nbsp;2 creates six different
    variables, some of type <code>string</code>, some of type
    <code>int</code>, and some of type <code>float</code>. Lines
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l01_prepare_ex2">4&ndash;5 and 7&ndash;8</span> of
    example&nbsp;2 demonstrate that no matter what the user types, the
    <code>input()</code> function always returns a string. Lines
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l01_prepare_ex2">13&nbsp;and&nbsp;14</span>
    show how to use the <code>int()</code> and <code>float()</code>
    functions to convert a string to a number so that the numbers can be
    used in calculations.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l01_prepare_ex2"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 2

# The input function always returns a string.
k = input("Please enter a number: ")        # string
m = input("Please enter another number: ")  # string
n = k + m          # string plus string makes string
print(f"k: {type(k)} {k}")
print(f"m: {type(m)} {m}")
print(f"n: {type(n)} {n}")
print()

# The int and float functions convert a string to a number.
p = int(input("Please enter a number: "))          # int
q = float(input("Please enter another number: "))  # float
r = p + q                     # int plus float makes float
print(f"p: {type(p)} {p}")
print(f"q: {type(q)} {q}")
print(f"r: {type(r)} {r}")</pre></div>

    <h3 id="l01_prepare_arith">Arithmetic</h3>
    <p>Python has many <dfn>arithmetic operators</dfn> including power
    (**), negation (-), multiplication (*), division (/), floor division
    (//), modulo (%), addition (+), and subtraction (-).</p>

    <h3 id="l01_prepare_op_prec">Operator Precedence</h3>
    <p>When we write an arithmetic expression that contains more than
    one operator, the computer executes the operators according to their
    <dfn>precedence</dfn>, also known as the <dfn>order of
    operations</dfn>. This table shows the precedence for the arithmetic
    operators.</p>

    <table class="center prec"><thead>
        <tr><th>Operators</th> <th>Description</th> <th>Precedence</th></tr>
    </thead><tbody>
        <tr><td>( )</td> <td>parentheses</td>
            <td class="prec">highest</td></tr>
        <tr><td>**</td> <td>exponentiation (power)</td>
            <td class="prec">&uarr;</td></tr>
        <tr><td>-</td> <td>negation</td>
            <td class="prec">|</td></tr>
        <tr><td>* &nbsp;/ &nbsp;// &nbsp;%</td>
            <td>multiplication, division, floor division, modulo</td>
            <td class="prec">|</td></tr>
        <tr><td>+ &nbsp;-</td> <td>addition, subtraction</td>
            <td class="prec">&darr;</td></tr>
        <tr><td>=</td> <td>assignment</td>
            <td class="prec">lowest</td></tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <div class="p">When an arithmetic expression includes two operators
    with the same precedence, the computer evaluates the operators from
    left to right. For example, in the arithmetic expression
    <div class="inline formula">x / y * c</div> the computer will first
    divide <var>x</var> by <var>y</var> and then multiply that result by
    <var>c</var>. If you need the computer to evaluate a lower
    precedence operator before a higher precedence one, you can add
    parentheses to the expression to change the evaluation order. The
    computer will always evaluate arithmetic that is inside parentheses
    first because parentheses have the highest precedence of all the
    arithmetic operators.</div>

    <p>If this is the first time that you have encountered arithmetic
    operator precedence, you should watch this Khan Academy video:
    <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-sixth-grade-math/cc-6th-arithmetic-operations/cc-6th-order-of-operations/v/introduction-to-order-of-operations">Introduction to Order of Operations</a>

    <p>The Python program in example&nbsp;3 gets input from the user and
    converts the user input into two numbers on lines
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l01_prepare_ex3">9&nbsp;and&nbsp;10</span>. Then
    at <span class="cross" data-ref="l01_prepare_ex3">line&nbsp;13</span> the
    program computes the length of a cable from the two numbers. Finally
    at <span class="cross" data-ref="l01_prepare_ex3">line&nbsp;17</span>, the
    program uses an f-string to print the length rounded to two places
    after the decimal point.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l01_prepare_ex3"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 3

# Given the distance that a cable will span and the distance
# it will sag or dip in the middle, this program computes the
# length of the cable.

# Get user input and convert it from
# strings to floating point numbers.
span = float(input("Distance the cable must span in meters: "))
dip = float(input("Distance the cable will sag in meters: "))

# Use the numbers to compute the cable length.
length = span + (8 * dip**2) / (3 * span)

# Print the cable length in the
# console window for the user to see.
print(f"Length of cable in meters: {length:.2f}")</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="l01_prepare_ex3">&gt; python example_3.py
Distance the cable must span in meters: <span class="input">500</span>
Distance the cable will sag or dip in meters: <span class="input">18.5</span>
Length of cable in meters: 501.83</pre>

    <p>In example&nbsp;3, the arithmetic that is written on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l01_prepare_ex3">line&nbsp;13</span>
    comes from a well known formula. Given the distance that a cable
    must span and the vertical distance that the cable will be allowed
    to sag or dip in the middle of the cable, the formula for
    calculating the length of the cable is:</p>

    <div class="block formula"><var>length</var> = <var>span</var> + <div class="fract"><div>8 <var>dip</var><sup>2</sup></div><div>3 <var>span</var></div></div></div>

    <h3 id="l01_prepare_short_ops">Shorthand Operators</h3>
    <p>The Python programming language includes many <dfn>augmented
    assignment operators</dfn>, also known as <dfn>shorthand
    operators</dfn>. All the shorthand operators have the same
    precedence as the assignment operator (=). Here is a list of some of
    the Python shorthand operators:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">**=  *=  /=  //=  %=  +=  -=</pre></div>

    <p>To understand what the shorthand operators do and why Python
    includes them, imagine a program that computes the price of a pizza.
    The price of a large pizza with cheese and no other toppings is
    $10.95. The price of each topping, such as ham, pepperoni, olives,
    and pineapple is $1.45. Here is a short example program that asks
    the user for the number of toppings and computes the price of a
    pizza:</p>

<div class="pre" id="l01_prepare_ex4"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 4

# Compute the total price of a pizza.

# The base price of a large pizza is $10.95
price = 10.95

# Ask the user for the number of toppings.
number_of_toppings = int(input("How many toppings? "))

# Compute the cost of the toppings.
price_per_topping = 1.45
toppings_cost = number_of_toppings * price_per_topping

# Add the cost of the toppings to the price of the pizza.
<em>price = price + toppings_cost</em>

# Print the price for the user to see.
print(f"Price: ${price:.2f}")</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="l01_prepare_ex4">&gt; python example_4.py
How many toppings? <span class="input">3</span>
Price: $15.30</pre>

    <p>The statement at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l01_prepare_ex4">line&nbsp;16</span> in
    example&nbsp;4 causes the computer to get the value in the
    <var>price</var> variable which is 10.95, then add the cost of the
    toppings to 10.95, and then store the sum back into the
    <var>price</var> variable. Python includes a shorthand operator that
    combines addition (+) and assignment (=) into one operator (+=). We
    can use this shorthand operator to rewrite line&nbsp;16 like
    this:</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">price += toppings_cost</pre></div>

    <p>This statement with the shorthand operator is equivalent to the
    statement on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l01_prepare_ex4">line&nbsp;16</span>
    of example&nbsp;4, meaning the two statements cause the computer to
    do the same thing. Example&nbsp;5 contains the same program as
    example&nbsp;4 but uses the shorthand operator += at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l01_prepare_ex5">line&nbsp;16</span>.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l01_prepare_ex5"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 5

# Compute the total price of a pizza.

# The base price of a large pizza is $10.95
price = 10.95

# Ask the user for the number of toppings.
number_of_toppings = int(input("How many toppings? "))

# Compute the cost of the toppings.
price_per_topping = 1.45
toppings_cost = number_of_toppings * price_per_topping

# Add the cost of the toppings to the price of the pizza.
<em>price += toppings_cost</em>

# Print the price for the user to see.
print(f"Price: ${price:.2f}")</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="l01_prepare_ex5">&gt; python example_5.py
How many toppings? <span class="input">3</span>
Price: $15.30</pre>

    <h3 id="l01_prepare_if">if Statements</h3>
    <p>In Python, we use <code>if</code> statements to cause the
    computer to make decisions; <code>if</code> statements are also
    called <dfn>selection</dfn> statements because the computer selects
    one group of statements to execute and skips the other group of
    statements.</p>

    <p>There are six comparison operators that we can use in an
    <code>if</code> statement:</p>

    <table class="center"><tbody>
        <tr><td>&lt;</td> <td>less than</td></tr>
        <tr><td>&lt;=</td> <td>less than or equal</td></tr>
        <tr><td>&gt;</td> <td>greater than</td></tr>
        <tr><td>&gt;=</td> <td>greater than or equal</td></tr>
        <tr><td>==</td> <td>equal to</td></tr>
        <tr><td>!=</td> <td>not equal to</td></tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p>Example&nbsp;6 contains Python code that checks if a number is
    greater than 500.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l01_prepare_ex6"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 6

# Get an account balance as a number from the user.
balance = float(input("Enter the account balance: "))

# If the balance is greater than 500, then
# compute and add interest to the balance.
if <em>balance &gt; 500</em>:
    interest = balance * 0.03
    balance += interest

# Print the balance.
print(f"balance: {balance:.2f}")</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="l01_prepare_ex6">&gt; python example_6.py
Enter the account balance: <span class="input">350</span>
balance: 350.0

&gt; python example_6.py
Enter the account balance: <span class="input">525</span>
balance: 540.75</pre>

    <p>If you have written programs in other programming languages such
    as JavaScript, Java, or C++, you always used curly braces to mark
    the start and end of the body of an <code>if</code> statement.
    However, notice in example&nbsp;6 that <code>if</code> statements in
    Python do not use curly braces. Instead, we type a colon (:) after
    the comparison of the <code>if</code> statement as shown on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l01_prepare_ex6">line&nbsp;8</span>.
    Then we indent all the statements that are in the body of the
    <code>if</code> statement as shown on lines
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l01_prepare_ex6">9&nbsp;and&nbsp;10</span>.
    The body of the <code>if</code> statement ends with the first line
    of code that is not indented, like
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l01_prepare_ex6">line&nbsp;13</span>.</p>

    <p>It may seem strange to not use curly braces to mark the start and
    end of the body of an <code>if</code> statement. However, the Python
    way forces us to write code where the indentation matches the
    functionality or in other words, the way we indent the code matches
    the way that the computer will execute the code.</p>

    <h3 id="l01_prepare_if_elif">if &hellip; elif &hellip; else Statements</h3>
    <p>Each <code>if</code> statement may have an <code>else</code>
    statement as shown in example&nbsp;7 on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l01_prepare_ex7">line&nbsp;13</span>.
    We can combine <code>else</code> and <code>if</code> into the
    keyword <code>elif</code> as shown on lines
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l01_prepare_ex7">9&nbsp;and&nbsp;11</span>.

<div class="pre" id="l01_prepare_ex7"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 7

# Get the cost of an item from the user.
cost = float(input("Please enter the cost: "))

# Determine a discount rate based on the cost.
<em>if</em> cost &lt; 100:
    rate = 0.10
<em>elif</em> cost &lt; 250:
    rate = 0.15
<em>elif</em> cost &lt; 400:
    rate = 0.18
<em>else</em>:
    rate = 0.20

# Compute the discount amount
# and the discounted cost.
discount = cost * rate
cost -= discount

# Print the discounted cost for the user to see.
print(f"After the discount, you will pay {cost:.2f}")</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="l01_prepare_ex7">&gt; python example_7.py
Please enter the cost: <span class="input">300</span>
After the discount, you will pay 246.0</pre>

    <h3 id="l01_prepare_logic_ops">Logical Operators</h3>
    <p>Python includes two <dfn>logic operators</dfn> which are the
    keywords <code>and</code>, <code>or</code> that we can use to
    combine two comparisons. Python also includes the logical
    <code>not</code> operator. Notice in Python that the logical
    operators are literally the words: <code>and</code>,
    <code>or</code>, <code>not</code> and not symbols as in other
    programming languages:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
if driver &gt;= 54 <em>or</em> (driver &gt;= 32 <em>and</em> passenger &gt;= 54):
    message = "Enjoy the ride!"</pre></div>

    <h2 id="l01_prove_problem">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>The size of a car tire in the United States is represented with

    third number is the diameter in inches of the wheel that the tire
    fits. The volume of space inside a tire can be approximated with
    this formula:</p>

    <div class="block formula"><var>v</var> = <div class="fract"><div>&pi;&thinsp;<var>w</var><sup>2</sup>&thinsp;<var>a</var><span class="paren"><var>w</var>&thinsp;<var>a</var> + 2,540&thinsp;<var>d</var></span></div><div>10,000,000,000</div></div></div>

    <ul>
        <li><div><var>v</var> is the volume in liters,</div></li>
        <li><div>&pi; is the constant PI, which is the ratio of the

    <h1>02 Prepare: Calling Functions</h1>

    <p>Because most useful computer programs are very large, programmers
    divide their programs into parts. Dividing a program into parts
    makes it easier to write, debug, and understand. A programmer can
    divide a Python program into modules, classes, and functions. In
    this lesson, you will learn how to call existing functions, and in
    the next lesson, you will learn how to write your own functions.</p>

    <h2 id="l02_prepare_concepts">Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn during this lesson.</p>

    <h3 id="l02_prepare_func_def">What Is a Function?</h3>
    <p>A <dfn>function</dfn> is a group of statements (computer
    commands) that together perform one task. Broadly speaking, there
    are four types of functions in Python which are:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Built-in functions</div></li>
        <li><div>Standard library functions</div></li>
        <li><div>Third-party functions</div></li>
        <li><div>User-defined functions</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>A programmer (you) can save lots of time by using existing
    functions. In this lesson, you will learn how to use (call) the
    first two types of functions. In
    <a href="../lesson05/prepare.html">lesson&nbsp;5</a>, you will learn
    how to install third-party modules and call third-party functions.
    In the <a href="../lesson03/prepare.html">next lesson</a>, you will
    learn how to write and call user-defined functions.</p>

    <h3 id="l02_prepare_built_in_funcs">Built-in Functions</h3>
    <p>Python includes many <dfn>built-in functions</dfn> such as:
    <code>input</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>,
    <code>str</code>, <code>len</code>, <code>range</code>,
    <code>abs</code>, <code>round</code>, <code>list</code>,
    <code>dict</code>, <code>open</code>, and <code>print</code>. These
    are called built-in functions because you don't have to import any
    module to use them. They are simply a built-in part of the Python
    language. You can read about the built-in functions in the
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html">Built-in
    Functions</a> section of the official Python online
    reference.</p>

    <h3 id="l02_prepare_call_func">How to Call a Function</h3>
    <p>A programmer uses a function by calling it (also known as
    invoking it). To <dfn>call</dfn> (or <dfn>invoke</dfn>) a function
    means to write code that causes the computer to execute the code
    that is inside that function. Regardless of the type of function
    (built-in, standard, third-party, or user-defined), a function is
    called by writing its name followed by a set of parentheses
    (&nbsp;). During CSE&nbsp;110 and&nbsp;111, you often wrote code
    that called the built-in <code>input</code> and <code>print</code>
    functions like this:</p>

<div class="pre" id="l02_prepare_ex1"><pre class="python">
name = input("Please enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello {name}")</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="l02_prepare_ex1">&gt; python example_1.py
Please enter your name: <span class="input">Miyuki</span>
Hello Miyuki</pre>

    <p>To call a function you must know the following three things:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>The name of the function</div></li>
        <li><div>The parameters that the function takes</div></li>
        <li><div>What the function does</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>These three pieces of information are normally available in
    online documentation. For example, from the online Python
    reference for the
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input"><code>input</code></a>
    function, we read this:</p>

    <dl class="function">
        <dt><pre class="python">input(prompt)</pre></dt>
        <dd>Write the <var>prompt</var> parameter to the terminal
        window, then read a line of user input from the terminal
        window, convert the input to a string, and return the input
        as a string.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>From this short description, we know the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>The name of the function is
        <code>input</code>.</div></li>
        <li><div>The function takes one parameter named
        <var>prompt</var>.</div></li>
        <li><div>The function writes the prompt to a terminal window and
        then reads user input from the terminal and returns that input
        to the calling function.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>A <dfn>parameter</dfn> is a piece of data that a function needs
    in order to complete its task. In the online reference for the
    <code>input</code> function, we see that the <code>input</code>
    function has one parameter named <var>prompt</var>.</p>

    <p>An <dfn id="l02_prepare_arg">argument</dfn> is the value that is passed
    through a parameter into a function. In other words, parameters are
    listed in a function's documentation, and arguments are listed in a
    call to a function.</p>

    <p>To write code that calls a function, we normally do the
    following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Type a new variable name and use the assignment
        operator (=) to assign a value to the variable.</div></li>
        <li><div>Type the name of the function followed by a set of
        parentheses.</div></li>
        <li><div>Between the parentheses, type arguments that the
        computer will pass into the function through its
        parameters.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>For example, the following code calls the built-in
    <code>input</code> function and passes the string <code>"Please
    enter your name: "</code> as the argument for the <var>prompt</var>
    parameter.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">name = input("Please enter your name: ")</pre></div>

    <p>When a function has more than one parameter and a programmer
    writes code to call that function, the programmer nearly always
    writes the arguments in the same order as the parameters. Consider
    the description of the built-in
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round"><code>round</code></a>
    function:</p>

    <!-- At this point in their computer programming education,
    most students are familiar with only a few functions. In addition,
    many of the students do not know enough math to successfully pass
    college algebra. It was difficult to choose a Python function with
    multiple parameters and a purpose that most students would
    understand. I settled on the round function even though its second
    parameter is optional. Here are some other functions that I
    considered writing about in this list item: divmod, pow, range,
    open, math.comb, math.perm, math.dist, math.remainder -->

    <dl class="function">
        <dt><pre class="python">round(number, ndigits)</pre></dt>
        <dd>Return <var>number</var> rounded to
        <var>ndigits</var> precision after the decimal point. If
        <var>ndigits</var> is omitted or is <code>None</code>,
        <code>round</code> returns the nearest integer to
        <var>number</var>.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Now consider this Python code that gets a number from a user,
    rounds that number to two digits after the decimal, and then prints
    the rounded number.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l02_prepare_ex2"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python">
n = float(input("Please enter a number: "))
r = round(n, 2)
print(r)</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="l02_prepare_ex2">&gt; python example_2.py
Please enter a number: <span class="input">95.716</span>
95.72</pre>

    <p>In the previous example,</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>The code on
        <span class="cross" data-ref="l02_prepare_ex2">line&nbsp;1</span> causes
        the computer to call the built-in <code>input</code>
        function and then call the built-in <code>float</code>
        function.</div></li>

        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="l02_prepare_ex2">Line&nbsp;2</span>
        causes the computer to call the built-in <code>round</code>
        function and pass two arguments. Notice that the order of
        the arguments matches the order of the parameters.
        Specifically, the number to be rounded (<var>n</var>) is the
        first argument, and the number of digits after the decimal
        point (2) is the second argument.</div></li>

        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="l02_prepare_ex2">Line&nbsp;3</span>
        causes the computer to call the built-in <code>print</code>
        function to print the rounded number.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="l02_prepare_opt_args">Optional Arguments</h3>
    <p>When calling a function or method, some arguments are
    <dfn>optional</dfn>. Again consider the description of the built-in
    <code>round</code> function:</p>

    <dl class="function">
        <dt><pre class="python">round(number, ndigits)</pre></dt>
        <dd>Return <var>number</var> rounded to
        <var>ndigits</var> precision after the decimal point. If
        <var>ndigits</var> is omitted or is <code>None</code>,
        <code>round</code> returns the nearest integer to
        <var>number</var>.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>From the description, we read that the second argument is
    optional. If the programmer doesn't type a second argument, the
    value in the <var>number</var> parameter will be rounded to an
    integer. The next code example is similar to the previous example.
    The only difference is that at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l02_prepare_ex3">line&nbsp;2</span> of the next
    example the programmer typed only one argument to the
    <code>round</code> function. Because the programmer omitted the
    second argument, the <code>round</code> function will round the
    number in its first parameter to an integer, which is shown in the
    output below.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l02_prepare_ex3"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python">
n = float(input("Please enter a number: "))
r = round(n)
print(r)</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="l02_prepare_ex3">&gt; python example_3.py
Please enter a number: <span class="input">95.716</span>
96</pre>

    <h3 id="l02_prepare_named_args">Named Arguments</h3>
    <p>For some optional arguments, we must pass a <dfn>named
    argument</dfn>, which is an argument that is preceded by the name of
    its matching parameter. For example, here is an excerpt from the
    documentation for the <code>print</code> function:</p>

    <dl class="function">
        <dt><pre class="python">print(*objects, sep=" ", end="\n", file=sys.stdout, flush=False)</pre></dt>
        <dd>Print objects to the text stream <var>file</var>,
        separated by <var>sep</var> and followed by <var>end</var>.
        <var>sep</var>, <var>end</var>, <var>file</var> and
        <var>flush</var>, if present, must be given as named
        arguments.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Notice from the excerpt that the <code>print</code> function can
    take many objects that will be printed. Optionally, it can take
    parameters named <var>sep</var>, <var>end</var>, <var>file</var>,
    and <var>flush</var> that must be named when they are used. For
    example, this code calls the <code>print</code> function to print
    three words all separated by a vertical bar (|). Notice the named
    arguments <var>sep</var> and <var>flush</var>.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l02_prepare_ex4"><pre class="python">
x = "sun"
y = "moon"
z = "stars"
print(x, y, z, sep="|", flush=True)</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="l02_prepare_ex4">&gt; python example_4.py
sun|moon|stars</pre>

    <h3 id="l02_prepare_call_module_func">How to Call a Function that Is inside a Module</h3>
    <p>A Python <dfn>module</dfn> is a collection of related functions.
    The Python <dfn>standard library</dfn> includes many modules which
    have more functions, such as the <code>math</code>
    module&mdash;which includes the <code>floor</code>,
    <code>ceil</code>, and <code>sqrt</code> functions and the
    <code>random</code> module&mdash;which includes the
    <code>randint</code>, <code>choice</code>, and <code>shuffle</code>
    functions. Consider the description of the
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.sqrt"><code>sqrt</code></a>
    function that is in the standard <code>math</code> module:</p>

    <dl class="function">
        <dt><pre class="python">math.sqrt(x)</pre></dt>
        <dd>Return the square root of <var>x</var>.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>From this short description, we know the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>The name of the containing module is
        <code>math</code>.</div></li>
        <li><div>The name of the function is
        <code>sqrt</code>.</div></li>
        <li><div>The function takes one parameter named
        <var>x</var>.</div></li>
        <li><div>The function computes and returns the square root
        of the number that is in <var>x</var>.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>To use any code that is in a module, you must import the module
    into your program and precede the function name with the module
    name. For example, if you wish to call the <code>math.sqrt</code>
    function, you must first import the <code>math</code> module and
    then type <code>math.</code> in front of <code>sqrt</code> like
    this:</p>

<div class="pre" id="l02_prepare_ex5"><pre class="python">import math

r = math.sqrt(71)
print(r)</pre></div>
<pre class="console" data-for="l02_prepare_ex5">&gt; python example_5.py
8.426149773176359</pre>

    <p>In the above example, 71 is the argument that will be passed
    through the parameter <var>x</var> into the <code>math.sqrt</code>
    function. The <code>math.sqrt</code> function will compute the
    square root of 71 and return the computed value that will then be
    stored in the variable <var>r</var>. You can read more about the
    standard modules in the official documentation for the
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/">Python Standard
    Library</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="l02_prepare_call_method">How to Call a Method</h3>
    <p>Python is an object-oriented language and includes many classes
    and objects. A <dfn>method</dfn> is a function that belongs to a
    class or object. Even though classes and objects are not part of
    this course (CSE&nbsp;111), calling a method in Python is so common
    and so easy that you should know how to do it. A method is a kind of
    function, so calling a method is similar to calling a function. The
    difference is that to call a method we must type the name of the
    object and a period (.) in front of the method name.</p>

    <p>Consider the program in example&nbsp;6 that gets a string of text
    from a user and prints the number of characters in the string and
    prints the string in all upper case characters.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l02_prepare_ex6"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 6

# Get a string of text from the user.
text1 = input("Enter a motivational quote: ")

# Call the built-in len function to get
# the number of characters in the text.
length = <em>len(text1)</em>

# Call the string upper method to convert
# the quote to upper case characters.
text2 = <em>text1.upper()</em>

# Call the built-in print function to print
# the length of the text and the text in all
# upper case for the user to see.
print(length, text2)</pre></div>

<pre class="console">&gt; python example_6.py
Enter a motivational quote: <span class="input">Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</span>
32 RISE, TAKE UP THY BED, AND WALK.</pre>

    <p>Notice the code on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l02_prepare_ex6">line&nbsp;8</span>
    calls the built-in <code>len</code> function and the code on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l02_prepare_ex6">line&nbsp;12</span>
    calls the string <code>upper</code> method. Compare the function
    call in <span class="cross" data-ref="l02_prepare_ex6">line&nbsp;8</span> to the
    method call in <span class="cross" data-ref="l02_prepare_ex6">line&nbsp;12</span>.
    To call the <code>len</code> function, we type the name of the
    function followed by a list of arguments inside parentheses. To call
    the <code>upper</code> method, we type the name of the object
    (<code>text1</code>) and a period, then the method name
    (<code>upper</code>), and then a list of arguments inside
    parentheses.</p>

    <p>A method can receive arguments just like a function can. However,
    in example&nbsp;6 at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l02_prepare_ex6">line&nbsp;12</span>, there are no
    arguments passed to the <code>upper</code> method, so the
    parentheses are empty. In order for the computer to call the
    <code>upper</code> method, a programmer must type the empty
    parentheses. In other words, if you write a line of code to call the
    <code>upper</code> method but don't type the empty parentheses, like
    this:</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">text2 = text1.upper  # Does NOT call the upper method</pre></div>

    <p>the computer will not call the <code>upper</code> method. Instead
    the computer will assign a reference to the <code>upper</code>
    method to the <var>text2</var> variable. You don't want the computer
    to do this because assigning a function reference won't make sense
    to you until you study functional programming.</p>

    <h3 id="l02_prepare_store_returned_val">How to Store a Returned Value</h3>
    <p>All the previous examples in this prepare content use the
    assignment operator (=) to store the value returned from a function
    in a variable. For example:</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="python"><em>text =</em> input("Enter a motivational quote: ")</pre></div>

    <p>While it's usually a good practice, you don't <em>have</em> to
    store the value that is returned from a function in a variable.
    Sometimes you will see it used directly as shown in example&nbsp;7 at
    lines <span class="cross" data-ref="l02_prepare_ex7">10,&nbsp;14, and&nbsp;16</span>.

<div class="pre" id="l02_prepare_ex7"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 7

import math

# Get a number from the user.
number = float(input("Enter a number: "))

# Call the math.sqrt function and
# immediately print its return value.
print( <em>math.sqrt(number)</em> )

# Call the math.sqrt function again and
# use its return value in an if statement.
if <em>math.sqrt(number)</em> &lt; 100:
    print(f"The square root is less than 100.")
elif <em>math.sqrt(number)</em> &gt; 100:
    print(f"The square root is more than 100.")
else:
    print(f"The square root is exactly 100.")</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="l02_prepare_ex7">&gt; python example_7.py
Enter a number: <span class="input">675</span>
25.98076211353316
The square root is less than 100.</pre>

    <p>Notice in example&nbsp;7, there are three statements that call
    the <code>math.sqrt</code> function, one at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l02_prepare_ex7">line&nbsp;10</span>
    to print the square root, another at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l02_prepare_ex7">line&nbsp;14</span>
    to check if the square root is less than 100, and yet another at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l02_prepare_ex7">line&nbsp;16</span>
    to check if the square root is greater than 100. Every time the
    computer calls a function, the computer will execute the code that
    is inside that function. In example&nbsp;7, because the arguments
    are the same at lines
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l02_prepare_ex7">10,&nbsp;14 and&nbsp;16</span>,
    the returned result will be the same in all three cases. So it would
    be faster to save the result in a variable and reuse the variable
    instead, as shown in example&nbsp;8 at lines
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l02_prepare_ex8">10,&nbsp;12,&nbsp;14,
    and&nbsp;16</span>.</p>

print(f"The square root is {<em>root</em>:.2f}")

if <em>root</em> &lt; 100:
    print(f"The square root is less than 100.")

    <h1>02 Checkpoint: Calling Functions</h1>

    <h2 id="l02_check_purpose">Purpose</h2>
    <p>Check your understanding of calling built-in Python functions and
    functions that are in a standard Python module.</p>

    <h2 id="l02_check_problem">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>In our modern world economy, many items are manufactured in large
    factories, then packed in boxes and shipped to distribution centers
    and retail stores. A common question for employees who pack items is
    "How many boxes do we need?"</p>

    <h2 id="l02_check_assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>A manufacturing company needs a program that will help its
    employees pack manufactured items into boxes for shipping. Write a
    Python program named <code>boxes.py</code> that asks the user for
    two integers:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>the number of manufactured items</div></li>
        <li><div>the number of items that the user will pack per box</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Your program must compute and print the number of boxes necessary
    to hold the items. This must be a whole number. Note that the last
    box may be packed with fewer items than the other boxes.</p>

    <h2 id="l02_check_helpful_docs">Helpful Documentation</h2>

<pre class="console" style="margin-left:-1.5em">&gt; python boxes.py
Enter the number of items: <span class="input">8</span>
Enter the number of items per box: <span class="input">5</span>

For 8 items, packing 5 items in each box, you will need 2 boxes.

&gt; python boxes.py
Enter the number of items: <span class="input">25</span>
Enter the number of items per box: <span class="input">4</span>

For 25 items, packing 4 items in each box, you will need 7 boxes.</pre>

    <h1>02 Team Activity: Calling Functions</h1>

    <h2 id="l02_teach_instrucs">Instructions</h2>
    <p>Each lesson in CSE 111 contains a team activity that is designed
    to take about one hour to complete. You should prepare for all team
    activities by completing the preparation material and the individual
    checkpoint assignment before starting a team activity. The goal of
    the team activities is for students to work together and teach and
    learn from each other. As your team completes a team activity,
    instead of moving through it as quickly as you can, you should help
    everyone understand the concepts.</p>

    <h3>Face-to-Face Students</h3>
    <p>Face-to-face students will complete the team activities in their
    classroom during class time.</p>

    <h3>Online Students in a Semester Section</h3>
    <p>Online students in a semester section will arrange and
    participate in a one hour synchronous video meeting with your team
    for each team activity. As your team works through the assignment,
    be certain that each student can see the code that is being typed.
    When your team completes the video meeting, share the final Python
    file with everyone on your team.</p>

    <h3>Online Students in a Block Section</h3>
    <p>Students in a block section complete two lessons each week. This
    means that online students in a block section will complete two team
    activities each week. For one of these two activities, your team
    should arrange and participate in a one hour synchronous video
    meeting. For the other team activity, your team may meet in a
    synchronous video meeting or your team may collaborate, ask and
    answer questions, and share code in Microsoft Teams.</p>

    <p>As your team works through a team assignment in a synchronous
    video meeting, be certain that each student can see the code that is
    being typed. When your team completes the video meeting, share the
    final Python file with everyone on your team.</p>

    <h2 id="l02_teach_purpose">Purpose</h2>
    <p>Improve your understanding of calling built-in Python functions
    and calling functions and methods that are in a standard Python
    module.</p>

    <h2 id="l02_teach_problem">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>You work for a retail store that wants to increase sales on
    Tuesday and Wednesday, which are the store's slowest sales days. On
    Tuesday and Wednesday, if a customer's subtotal is $50 or greater,
    the store will discount the customer's subtotal by 10%.</p>

    <h2 id="l02_teach_assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>Work as a team to write a Python program named
    <code>discount.py</code> that gets a customer's subtotal as input
    and gets the current day of the week from your computer's operating
    system. Your program must <strong>not</strong> ask the user to enter
    the day of the week. Instead, it must get the day of the week from
    your computer's operating system.</p>

    <p>If the subtotal is $50 or greater and today is Tuesday or
    Wednesday, your program must subtract 10% from the subtotal. Your
    program must then compute the total amount due by adding sales tax
    of 6% to the subtotal. Your program must print the discount amount
    if applicable, the sales tax amount, and the total amount due.</p>

    <h3 id="l02_teach_required">Core Requirements</h3>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Your program asks the user for the subtotal but does

        if today is Tuesday or Wednesday and the customer is not
        purchasing enough to receive the discount. This added code
        should compute and print the difference between $50 and the
        subtotal which is the additional amount the customer would need
        to purchase in order to receive the discount.</div></li>

        <li><div>Near the beginning of your program replace the code

    <h1>02 Prove: Calling Functions</h1>

    <h2 id="l02_prove_purpose">Purpose</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a Python program that calls functions
    and methods to get the current date and to append values to a text
    file.</p>

    <h2 id="l02_prove_problem">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Many companies wish to understand the needs and wants of their
    customers more deeply so the company can create products that fill
    those needs and wants. One way to understand customers more deeply
    is to record the values entered by customers while they are using a
    program and then to analyze those values. One common way to record
    values is for a program to store them in a file.</p>

    <h2 id="l02_prove_assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>The previous lesson's <a href="../lesson01/prove.html">prove
    milestone</a> required you to write a program named
    <code>tire_volume.py</code> that computes the approximate volume of
    air inside a tire. Add code near the end of that program that does
    the following:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Gets the current date from the computer's
        operating system.</div></li>
        <li><div>Opens a text file named <code>volumes.txt</code> for
        appending.</div></li>
        <li><div>Appends to the end of the <code>volumes.txt</code> file
        one line of text that contains the following five values:
        <ol>
            <li><div>current date</div></li>
            <li><div>width of the tire</div></li>
            <li><div>aspect ratio of the tire</div></li>
            <li><div>diameter of the wheel</div></li>
            <li><div>volume of the tire</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>
    </ol>

    <ul class="notes long">
        <li><p>For all assignments in CSE&nbsp;111, please write your
        program in a file named as the assignment states. Also, if an
        assignment requires your program to read from a file or write to
        a file, please use the filename stated in the assignment. If you
        name your program or a data file differently than stated in an
        assignment, it will be harder for the graders to score your
        submitted assignment.</p>

        <p>This assignment requires you to name your program
        <code>tire_volume.py</code> and requires your program to write
        to a file named <code>volumes.txt</code>. Please use those
        names.</p></li>

    <ul class="long">
        <li><div>The <a href="prepare.html">prepare content</a> for this

        <li><div><p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.now"><code>datetime.now()</code> method</a>
        from the standard Python <code>datetime</code> module will get
        the current date and time from your computer's operating system.
        Here is an excerpt from the official reference for the
        <code>datetime.now</code> method:</p>

        <dl class="function">
            <dt><pre class="python">datetime.now(tz=None)</pre></dt>
            <dd>Return the current local date and time.
            <p><var>tz</var> is optional, but if it is not
            <code>None</code>, it must be a <code>tzinfo</code> (time
            zone information) object</p></dd>
        </dl>

        <p>These two Microsoft videos explain how to use methods from
        the standard <code>datetime</code> module.</p>
        <ul class="videos">
            <li><div><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Intro-to-Python-Development/Python-for-Beginners-15-of-44-Date-Data-Types">Date data types</a> <span class="duration">(8 minutes)</span></div></li>

        </ul>

        <p>The following Python code imports the <code>datetime</code>
        class from the <code>datetime</code> module and calls the
        <code>datetime.now</code> method to get the current date and
        time from a computer's operating system. Then it uses an
        f-string to format and print the current date.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l02_prove_ex1"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python">
# Import the datetime class from the datetime
# module so that it can be used in this program.
from datetime import datetime

current_date_and_time = datetime.now()

# Use an f-string to print only the date
# part of the current date and time.
print(f"{current_date_and_time:%Y-%m-%d}")</pre></div>

        <p>After the computer executes
        <span class="cross" data-ref="l02_prove_ex1">line&nbsp;8</span> in the
        above code, the variable <var>current_date_and_time</var> will
        hold the current date and time. Within the f-string at
        <span class="cross" data-ref="l02_prove_ex1">line&nbsp;12</span>,
        the string sequences that begin with the percent symbol (%) are
        called format codes. The format codes and their meaning are
        listed in the official Python reference about
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes">Basic date and time types</a>.
        When executed, the previous example code will print the current
        date and time to the terminal window like this:</p>

        <li><div>The built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open"><code>open()</code> function</a>
        opens a file for reading or writing. Here is an excerpt from the

        <dl class="function">
            <dt><pre class="python">open(filename, mode="rt")</pre></dt>
            <dd>Open a file and return a corresponding file object.

            <p><var>mode</var> is an optional string that specifies the
            mode in which the file will be opened. It defaults to
            <code>"rt"</code> which means open for reading in text mode.
            Other common values are <code>"wt"</code> for writing a text
            file (truncating the file if it already exists), and
            <code>"at"</code> for appending to the end of a text file

        which includes several examples for opening and reading from a
        text file.</p>

        <p>The following example code calls the <code>open</code>
        function at <span class="cross" data-ref="l02_prove_ex2">line&nbsp;6</span>
        to open a file named <code>cities.txt</code> for
        <b>a</b>ppending <b>t</b>ext (<b>"at"</b>). The code then calls
        the <code>print</code> function two times at
        <span class="cross" data-ref="l02_prove_ex2">lines&nbsp;9 and&nbsp;10</span>
        to print two lines of text to the <code>cities.txt</code> file.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l02_prove_ex2">
<pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python">
city_name = "Accra"
elevation = 61

    print(city_name, <em>file=cities_file</em>)
    print(f"{elevation}, {population}", <em>file=cities_file</em>)</pre></div>

        <p>Notice in the previous example at
        <span class="cross" data-ref="l02_prove_ex2">line&nbsp;6</span> that the
        call to the <code>open</code> function is inside a
        <code>with</code> statement. Opening a file in a
        <code>with</code> statement, ensures that the computer will
        automatically close the file when the computer finishes
        executing the code inside the <code>with</code> block.</p>

        <p>The variable <var>cities_file</var>, which is created at
        <span class="cross" data-ref="l02_prove_ex2">line&nbsp;6</span>, is a
        reference to the open <code>cities.txt</code> file. At both
        lines
        <span class="cross" data-ref="l02_prove_ex2">lines&nbsp;9 and&nbsp;10</span>,
        the <var>cities_file</var> is a named argument that causes the
        <code>print</code> function to print to the
        <code>cities.txt</code> file insted of printing to the terminal
        window.</p>

    follow the instructions in the
    <a href="https://courses.byui.edu/AcademicSupport/tutoring-center/online-tutoring/online-courses-tutoring-guide.pdf">course tutoring guide</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="l02_prove_testing">Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="test long">
        <li><div>Run your program using the inputs shown below. Ensure
        that your program's output matches the output shown below.
<pre class="console">&gt; python tire_volume.py
Enter the width of the tire in mm (ex 205): <span class="input">185</span>
Enter the aspect ratio of the tire (ex 60): <span class="input">50</span>
Enter the diameter of the wheel in inches (ex 15): <span class="input">14</span>

The approximate volume is 24.09 liters</pre>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Use VS Code to open the <code>volumes.txt</code> file
        and verify that the last line of text in the file looks like
        this, except the date will be different:

    <h2 id="l02_prove_exceed">Exceeding the Requirements</h2>
    <p>If your program fulfills the requirements for this assignment as
    described in the previous prove milestone and the Assignment section
    above, your program will earn 93% of the possible points. In order
    to earn the remaining 7% of points, you will need to add one or more
    features to your program so that it exceeds the requirements. Here
    are a few suggestions for additional features that you could add to
    your program if you wish.</p>

    <ul class="long">
        <li><div>Find tire prices for four or more tire sizes online.
        Add a set of <code>if &hellip; elif &hellip; else</code>
        statements in your program that use the tire width, tire aspect
        ratio, and wheel diameter that the user enters to find a price
        and then print the price.</div></li>

        <li><div>After your program prints the tire volume to the
        terminal window, your program should ask the user if she wants
        to buy tires with the dimensions that she entered. If the user
        answers "yes", your program should ask for her phone number and
        store her phone number in the <code>volumes.txt</code>
        file.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="l02_prove_ponder">Ponder</h2>
    <p>During this assignment, you wrote code that gets the current date
    from your computer's operating system and that writes text to a file
    on your computer's hard drive. The code that you wrote calls the
    <code>datetime.now()</code>, <code>open()</code>, and
    <code>print()</code> functions. Would this assignment have been more
    difficult if those three functions didn't exist? Now that you know
    what functions are and how to call them in your code, are you able
    to write more complex programs?</p>

    <h2 id="l02_prove_submit">Submission</h2>
    <p>To submit your program, return to I-Learn and do these two
    things:</p>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Upload your program (the .py file) for feedback.</div></li>
        <li><div>Add a submission comment that specifies the grading

    <h1>03 Prepare: Writing Functions</h1>
    <p>Because most useful computer programs are very large, programmers
    divide their programs into parts. Dividing a program into parts
    makes it easier to write, debug, and understand the program. A
    programmer can divide a Python program into modules, classes, and
    functions. In this lesson and the next, you will learn how to write
    your own functions.</p>

    <h2 id="l03_prepare_concepts">Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn during this lesson.</p>

    <h3 id="l03_prepare_func_def">What Is a Function?</h3>
    <p>A <dfn>function</dfn> is a group of statements that together
    perform one task. Broadly speaking, there are four types of
    functions in Python which are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Built-in functions</div></li>
        <li><div>Standard library functions</div></li>
        <li><div>Third-party functions</div></li>
        <li><div>User-defined functions</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>In the previous lesson, you learned how to call the first two
    types of functions. In lesson&nbsp;5, you will learn how to install
    third-party modules and call third-party functions. In this lesson,
    you will learn how to write and call user-defined
    functions.</p>

    <h3 id="l03_prepare_user_def_func">What Is a User-Defined Function?</h3>
    <p>A <dfn>user-defined function</dfn> is a function that is not a
    built-in function, a standard function, or a third-party function. A
    user-defined function is written by a programmer like yourself as
    part of a program. For some students the term "user-defined
    function" is confusing because the user of a program doesn't define
    the function. Instead, the programmer (you) define user-defined
    functions. Perhaps a more correct term is programmer-defined
    function. Writing user-defined functions has several advantages,
    including:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>making your code more reusable</div></li>
        <li><div>making your code easier to understand and debug</div></li>
        <li><div>making your code easier to change and add
        capabilities</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="l03_prepare_write_user_func">How to Write a User-Defined Function</h3>
    <p>To write a user-defined function in Python, simply type code
    that matches this template:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
def <var>function_name</var>(<var>param1</var>, <var>param2</var>, &hellip; <var>paramN</var>):
    """<var>documentation string</var>"""
    <var>statement1</var>
    <var>statement2</var>
        &vellip;
    <var>statementN</var>
    return <var>value</var></pre></div>

    <p>The first line of a function is called the <dfn>header</dfn> or
    <dfn>signature</dfn>, and it includes the following:
    <ol>
        <li><div>the keyword <code>def</code> (which is an
        abbreviation for "define")</div></li>
        <li><div>the function name</div></li>
        <li><div>the parameter list (with the parameters separated
        by commas)</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Here is the header for a function named <code>draw_circle</code>
    that takes three parameters named <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>,
    and <code>radius</code>:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">def draw_circle(x, y, radius):</pre></div>

    <p>You could read the previous line of code as, "Define a function
    named <code>draw_circle</code> that takes three parameters named
    <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, and <var>radius</var>."</p>

    <p>The <dfn>function name</dfn> must start with a letter or the
    underscore (_). The rest of the name must be made of letters, digits
    (0–9), or the underscore. A function name cannot include spaces or
    other punctuation. A function name should be meaningful and should
    describe briefly what the function does. Well-named functions often
    start with a verb.</p>

    <p>The statements inside a function are called the <dfn>body</dfn>
    of the function. Just like other block statements in Python, such as
    <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>while</code>, and
    <code>for</code>, all of which end with a colon (:), you must indent
    the statements inside the body of a function. The body of a function
    should begin with a <dfn>documentation string</dfn> which is a
    triple quoted string that describes the function's purpose,
    parameters and return value. The body of a function may contain as
    many statements as you wish to write inside of it. However, it is a
    good idea to limit functions to less than 20 lines of code.</p>

    <figure class="right" style="width:11em">
        <img src="../lesson03/cylinder.png"
        alt="Diagram of a right circular cylinder with radius r and height h"
        title="Diagram of a right circular cylinder with radius r and height h">
        <figcaption>A right circular cylinder with radius <var>r</var>
        and height <var>h</var></figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Example&nbsp;1 contains a function named
    <code>print_cylinder_volume()</code> with no parameters that gets
    two numbers from the user: <var>radius</var> and <var>height</var>
    and uses those numbers to compute the volume of a right circular
    cylinder and then prints the volume for the user to see.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l03_prepare_ex1">
<pre class="python"># Example 1

import math

# Define a function named print_cylinder_volume.
def print_cylinder_volume():
    """Compute and print the volume of a cylinder.
    Parameters: none
    Return: nothing
    """
    # Get the radius and height from the user.
    radius = float(input("Enter the radius of a cylinder: "))
    height = float(input("Enter the height of a cylinder: "))

    # Compute the volume of the cylinder.
    volume = math.pi * radius**2 * height

    # Print the volume of the cylinder.
    print(f"Volume: {volume:.2f}")</pre></div>

    <p>Because the <code>print_cylinder_volume</code> function in
    example&nbsp;1 doesn't accept parameters, it must be called without
    any arguments like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">    print_cylinder_volume()</pre></div>

    <h3 id="l03_prepare_reusable_user_func">How to Make a User-Defined Function
    Reusable</h3>
    <p>Because the <code>print_cylinder_volume</code> function in
    example&nbsp;1 gets input from a user and prints its results to a
    terminal window, it can be used only in a program that runs when a
    user is present. It cannot be used in a program that runs
    automatically and gets input from a file or the network or a sensor.
    In other words, the <code>print_cylinder_volume</code> function in
    example&nbsp;1 is not reusable in other programs. The most
    <dfn>reusable functions</dfn> are ones that take parameters, perform
    calculations, and return a result but <em>do not perform user input
    and output</em>.</p>

    <p id="l03_prepare_param">The parameter list in a function's header contains
    data stored in variables that the function needs to complete its
    task. A <dfn>parameter</dfn> is a variable whose value comes from
    outside the function. One way to get input into a function is to ask
    the user for input by calling the built-in Python <code>input</code>
    function. Another way to get input into a function is through the
    function's parameters. Getting input through parameters is much more
    flexible than asking the user for input because the input through
    parameters can come from the user or a file on a hard drive or the
    network or a sensor or even another function.</p>

    <p>Example&nbsp;2 contains another version of the
    <code>print_cylinder_volume</code> function. This second version
    doesn't get the radius and height from the user. Instead, it gets
    input through its two parameters named <var>radius</var> and
    <var>height</var>.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l03_prepare_ex2">
<pre class="python"># Example 2

import math

# Define a function named print_cylinder_volume.
def print_cylinder_volume(<em>radius</em>, <em>height</em>):
    """Compute and print the volume of a cylinder.
    Parameters
        radius: the radius of the cylinder
        height: the height of the cylinder
    Return: nothing
    """
    # Compute the volume of the cylinder.
    volume = math.pi * radius**2 * height

    # Print the volume of the cylinder.
    print(volume)</pre></div>

    <p>Because the second version of the
    <code>print_cylinder_volume</code> function accepts two parameters,
    it must be called with two arguments like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">    print_cylinder_volume(2.5, 4.1)</pre></div>

    <p>To <dfn>return</dfn> a result from a function, simply type the
    keyword <code>return</code> followed by whatever result you want
    returned to the calling function. Example&nbsp;3 contains a third
    version of the cylinder volume function. Notice that the version in
    example&nbsp;3 returns the volume instead of printing it, which
    makes the function more reusable. Notice also in example&nbsp;3 that
    we changed the name of the function from
    <code>print_cylinder_volume</code> to
    <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code> because this version doesn't
    print the volume but instead returns it.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l03_prepare_ex3">
<pre class="python"># Example 3

import math

# Define a function named computer_cylinder_volume.
def compute_cylinder_volume(radius, height):
    """Compute and return the volume of a cylinder.
    Parameters
        radius: the radius of the cylinder
        height: the height of the cylinder
    Return: the volume of the cylinder
    """
    # Compute the volume of the cylinder.
    volume = math.pi * radius**2 * height

    # Return the volume of the cylinder so that the
    # volume can be used somewhere else in the program.
    <em>return volume</em></pre></div>

    <p>Many functions that you've used in the past such as
    <code>input</code>, <code>float</code>, and <code>round</code>,
    return a result. When a function returns a result, we usually write
    code to store that returned result in a variable to use later in the
    program like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">    <em>text =</em> input("Please enter your name: ")</pre></div>

    <p>Because the <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code> function in
    example&nbsp;3 accepts two parameters and returns a result, it
    could be called like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">     volume = compute_cylinder_volume(2.5, 4.1)</pre></div>

    <h3 id="l03_prepare_main_func">The <code>main</code> User-Defined Function</h3>
    <p>In all previous Python programs that you wrote in CSE&nbsp;110
    and&nbsp;111, you wrote statements that were not in a function like
    the simple program in example&nbsp;4.

<div class="pre" id="l03_prepare_ex4"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 4

import math

# Get the radius and height from the user.
radius = float(input("Enter the radius of a cylinder: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height of a cylinder: "))

# Compute the volume of the cylinder.
volume = math.pi * radius**2 * height

# Print the volume of the cylinder.
print(f"Volume: {volume:.2f}")</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="l03_prepare_ex4">&gt; python example_4.py
Enter the radius in centimeters: <span class="input">3</span>
Enter the height in centimeters: <span class="input">8</span>
Volume: 226.19</pre>

    <p>Writing statements outside a function can lead to poor
    organization within a large program. Professional software
    developers write statements inside a function whenever possible.
    Beginning with this lesson, you will write nearly all statements
    inside a user-defined function. Also, in each program, you will
    write a user-defined function named <code>main</code>, which will
    contain the beginning statements of the program. In addition, in
    each program you will write one or more user-defined functions that
    have parameteters, perform calculations and other useful work, and
    return a result to the call point. Example&nbsp;5 contains the same
    Python program as example&nbsp;4 except most of the statements are
    inside a user-defined function named <code>main</code>.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l03_prepare_ex5"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 5

import math

# Define a function named main.
def main():
    # Get the radius and height from the user.
    radius = float(input("Enter the radius of a cylinder: "))
    height = float(input("Enter the height of a cylinder: "))

    # Compute the volume of the cylinder.
    volume = math.pi * radius**2 * height

    # Print the volume of the cylinder.
    print(f"Volume: {volume:.2f}")

# Start this program by
# calling the main function.
main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="l03_prepare_ex5">&gt; python example_5.py
Enter the radius in centimeters: <span class="input">3</span>
Enter the height in centimeters: <span class="input">8</span>
Volume: 226.19</pre>

    <p>Notice the call to the <code>main</code> function at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l03_prepare_ex5">line&nbsp;19</span> in
    example&nbsp;5. Without that call to the <code>main</code> function,
    when we run the program, the program will do nothing. In all of your
    future programs in CSE&nbsp;111 you will write a user-defined
    function named <code>main</code> and will have a call to
    <code>main</code> at the bottom of the program.</p>

    <h3 id="l03_prepare_user_func_ex">A Complete Program with User-Defined Functions</h3>
    <p>If you look closely at the code in examples&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;5,
    you will realize that both programs have the same problem, namely
    both the <code>print_cylinder_volume</code> function in
    example&nbsp;1 and the <code>main</code> function in example&nbsp;5
    are not reusable because both of them get input from a user and
    print to a terminal window. A better way to write the program in
    examples&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;5 is to separate the program into two
    functions, one named <code>main</code> and one named
    <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code> as shown in example&nbsp;6.

    <p>Example&nbsp;6 contains a complete program with two functions,
    the first named <code>main</code>
    at <span class="cross" data-ref="l03_prepare_ex6">line&nbsp;6</span> and the
    second named <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code>
    at <span class="cross" data-ref="l03_prepare_ex6">line&nbsp;20</span>.
    At <span class="cross" data-ref="l03_prepare_ex6">line&nbsp;13</span>,
    the <code>main</code> function calls the
    <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code> function. Notice that the
    <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code> function gets its input through
    parameters and returns a result which makes this function reusable in
    other programs, including programs that run automatically without a
    user.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l03_prepare_ex6"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 6

import math

# Define the main function.
def main():
    # Get a radius and a height from the user.
    radius = float(input("Enter the radius of a cylinder: "))
    height = float(input("Enter the height of a cylinder: "))

    # Call the compute_cylinder_volume function and store
    # its return value in a variable to use later.
    <em>volume = compute_cylinder_volume(radius, height)</em>

    # Print the volume of the cylinder.
    print(f"Volume: {volume:.2f}")


# Define a function that accepts two parameters.
def compute_cylinder_volume(radius, height):
    """Compute and print the volume of a cylinder.
    Parameters
        radius: the radius of the cylinder
        height: the height of the cylinder
    Return: the volume of the cylinder
    """
    # Compute the volume of the cylinder.
    volume = math.pi * radius**2 * height

    # Return the volume of the cylinder so that the
    # volume can be used somewhere else in the program.
    # The returned result will be available wherever
    # this function was called.
    return volume


# Start this program by
# calling the main function.
main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="l03_prepare_ex6">&gt; python example_6.py
Enter the radius in centimeters: <span class="input">3</span>
Enter the height in centimeters: <span class="input">8</span>
Volume: 226.19</pre>

    <p>The most reusable functions are ones that have parameters,
    perform calculations, and return a result but <em>do not perform
    user input and output</em>. In the previous code example, there are
    two functions named <code>main</code> and
    <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code>. The <code>main</code> function
    is certainly useful in the program, but it is not reusable in other
    programs because it gets user input and prints the result for the
    user to see. The <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code> function is
    very reusable in another program because it doesn't get user input
    or print output. Instead, it takes two parameters, performs a
    calculation, and returns a result to the calling function. The
    <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code> function is so reusable that it
    could be included in a library of functions that compute the area
    and volume of 2-D and 3-D geometric shapes.</p>

    <h3 id="l03_prepare_func_call">What Happens When the Computer Calls a Function?</h3>
    <p>Some students have trouble visualizing what happens when the
    computer calls (executes) a function. The following diagram contains
    the same program as example&nbsp;6. The circled numbers show the
    order in which the events happen in the computer. The green numbers
    and arrows in the diagram show the order in which the computer
    executes statements in the program. The blue numbers and arrows show
    how data flows from arguments into parameters and from a returned
    result to a variable.</p>

    <figure class="code" style="width:34em">
        <img src="../lesson03/call.svg"
        alt="A diagram showing a call to a function and a value returned
        from that function"
        title="A diagram showing a call to a function and a value
        returned from that function">
    </figure>

    <p>A computer will execute the statements in the previous diagram in
    the following order:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha">
        <li><div>The statement at (1) is not inside a function, so
        the computer executes it when the program begins. The
        statement at (1) is a call to the <code>main</code> function
        which causes the computer to begin executing the statements
        inside <code>main</code> at (2).</div></li>

        <li><div>At (2), the computer gets two numbers from the
        user.</div></li>

        <li><div>The statement at (3) is a call to the
        <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code> function which causes the
        computer to copy the values in the arguments <var>r</var> and
        <var>h</var> into the parameters <var>radius</var> and
        <var>height</var> respectively and then begin executing the
        statements inside the <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code>
        function at (5).</div></li>

        <li><div>At (5), the computer computes the volume of a
        cylinder.</div></li>

        <li><div>The statement at (6) is a return statement which causes
        the computer to stop executing the
        <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code> function, to return the
        computed volume to the call point at (3), and to resume
        executing statements at the call point.</div></li>

        <li><div>At the call point (3), the computer stores the returned
        value in the variable named <var>v</var>.</div></li>

        <li><div>At (8), the computer prints the value that is in the
        <var>volume</var> variable for the user to see. This is the last
        statement in the <code>main</code> function, so after executing
        it, the computer resumes executing the statements after the call
        point (1) to <code>main</code>.</div></li>

        <li><div>At (9), there are no more statements after the call to
        <code>main</code>, so the computer terminates the
        program.</div></li>
    </ol>

        title="The key for reading call graphs">
    </figure>
    <p>A <dfn>call graph</dfn> is a diagram that shows function calls
    and returns within a program. A call graph can help you visualize
    how a program is divided into functions. Within a call graph, the
    unfilled circle shows where the computer begins executing a program.
    A rounded rectangle represents a function. A solid arrow represents
    a call from one function to another function. A dashed arrow
    represents a value returned from a called function to the calling
    function.</p>

    <p>The call graph below shows the function calls and returns for the
    program in example&nbsp;6. From the call graph, we see that the
    computer begins executing the program by calling the
    <code>main</code> function. While executing the <code>main</code>
    function, the computer calls the <code>input</code> and
    <code>float</code> functions. Then the computer calls the
    <code>compute_cylinder_volume</code> function. Finally the computer
    calls the <code>print</code> function. In the call graph we can see
    that the <code>main</code> and <code>print</code> functions don't
    return a value. The <code>print</code> function prints results for
    the user to see, but it doesn't return anything.</p>

    <h2 id="l03_prepare_summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>A function is a group of statements that together perform one
    task. A user-defined function is a function written by a programmer
    like you. To write a user-defined function, write code that follows
    this template:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
def <var>function_name</var>(<var>param1</var>, <var>param2</var>, &hellip; <var>paramN</var>):
    """<var>documentation string</var>"""
    <var>statement1</var>
    <var>statement2</var>
        &vellip;
    <var>statementN</var>
    return <var>value</var></pre></div>

    <p>To call a user-defined function, write code that follows this
    template:</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="python"><var>variable_name</var> = <var>function_name</var>(<var>arg1</var>, <var>arg2</var>, &hellip; <var>argN</var>)</pre></div>

    <p>The most reusable functions are ones that take parameters,
    perform calculations, and return a result but <em>do not perform
    user input and output</em>. All of your future programs in
    CSE&nbsp;111 will have a user-defined function named
    <code>main</code> and will have a call to <code>main</code> at the
    bottom of the program.</p>

    <p><strong>It is extremely important that you can write and call
    functions.</strong> After watching the videos and reading this
    prepare content, if the concepts still seem confusing or vague to
    you, pray and ask Heavenly Father to help you understand the
    concepts. Then watch the videos and read the concepts
    <strong>again</strong>.</p>

    <h1>03 Checkpoint: Writing Functions</h1>

    <h2 id="l03_check_purpose">Purpose</h2>
    <p>Check your understanding of writing your own functions with
    parameters and then calling those functions with arguments.</p>

    <h2 id="l03_check_problem">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Many vehicle owners record the fuel efficiency of their vehicles
    as a way to track the health of the vehicle. If the fuel efficiency
    of a vehicle suddenly drops, there is probably something wrong with
    the engine or drive train of the vehicle. In the United States, fuel
    efficiency for gasoline powered vehicles is calculated as miles per
    gallon. In most other countries, fuel efficiency is calculated as
    liters per 100 kilometers.</p>

    <p>The formula for computing fuel efficiency in miles per gallon
    is the following:</p>
    <div class="block formula"><var>mpg</var> = <div class="fract"><div><var>end</var> &minus; <var>start</var></div><div><var>gallons</var></div></div></div>
    <p>where <var>start</var> and <var>end</var> are both odometer
    values in miles and <var>gallons</var> is a fuel amount in U.S.
    gallons.</p>

    <p>The formula for converting miles per gallon to liters per 100
    kilometers is the following:</p>
    <div class="block formula"><var>lp100k</var> = <div class="fract"><div>235.215</div><div><var>mpg</var></div></div></div>

    <h2 id="l03_check_assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>Write a Python program that asks the user for three numbers:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>A starting odometer value in miles</div></li>
        <li><div>An ending odometer value in miles</div></li>
        <li><div>An amount of fuel in gallons</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Your program must calculate and print fuel efficiency in both
    miles per gallon and liters per 100 kilometers. Your program must
    have three functions named as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div><code>main</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>miles_per_gallon</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>lp100k_from_mpg</code></div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>All user input and printing must be in the <code>main</code>
    function. In other words, the <code>miles_per_gallon</code> and
    <code>lp100k_from_mpg</code> functions must not call the the
    <code>input</code> or <code>print</code> functions.

    <h2 id="l03_check_testing">Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Run your program and enter the inputs shown below.
        Ensure that your program's output matches the output below.

    <h2 id="l03_check_solution">Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>When your program is finished, view the <a class="solution"
    href="check_solution.py">sample solution</a> for this assignment to
    compare your solution to that one. Before looking at the sample
    solution, you should work to complete this checkpoint program.
    However, if you have worked on it for at least an hour and are still
    having problems, feel free to use the sample solution to help you
    finish your program.</p>

    <h3 id="l03_check_call_graph">Call Graph</h3>
    <p>The following call graph shows the function calls and returns in
    the sample solution for this assignment. From this call graph we see
    that the computer starts executing the sample program by calling the
    <code>main</code> function. While executing the <code>main</code>
    function, the computer calls the <code>input</code> and
    <code>float</code> functions. Then the computer calls the
    <code>miles_per_gallon</code> and <code>lp100k_from_mpg</code>
    functions. Finally the computer calls the <code>print</code>
    function which is the end of the program.</p>

    <h1>03 Team Activity: Writing Functions</h1>

    <h2 id="l03_teach_instrucs">Instructions</h2>
    <p>Each lesson in CSE 111 contains a team activity that is designed
    to take about one hour to complete. You should prepare for all team
    activities by completing the preparation material and the individual
    checkpoint assignment before starting a team activity. The goal of
    the team activities is for students to work together and teach and
    learn from each other. As your team completes a team activity,
    instead of moving through it as quickly as you can, you should help
    everyone understand the concepts.</p>

    <h3>Face-to-Face Students</h3>
    <p>Face-to-face students will complete the team activities in their
    classroom during class time.</p>

    <h3>Online Students in a Semester Section</h3>
    <p>Online students in a semester section will arrange and
    participate in a one hour synchronous video meeting with your team
    for each team activity. As your team works through the assignment,
    be certain that each student can see the code that is being typed.
    When your team completes the video meeting, share the final Python
    file with everyone on your team.</p>

    <h3>Online Students in a Block Section</h3>
    <p>Students in a block section complete two lessons each week. This
    means that online students in a block section will complete two team
    activities each week. For one of these two activities, your team
    should arrange and participate in a one hour synchronous video
    meeting. For the other team activity, your team may meet in a
    synchronous video meeting or your team may collaborate, ask and
    answer questions, and share code in Microsoft Teams.</p>

    <p>As your team works through a team assignment in a synchronous
    video meeting, be certain that each student can see the code that is
    being typed. When your team completes the video meeting, share the
    final Python file with everyone on your team.</p>

    <h2 id="l03_teach_purpose">Purpose</h2>
    <p>Boost your understanding of writing your own functions with
    parameters and then calling those functions with arguments.</p>

    <h2 id="l03_teach_problem">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Health professionals who are helping a client achieve a healthy
    body weight, sometimes use two computed measures named body mass
    index and basal metabolic rate.</p>

    <p>From the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention we read,
    "Body mass index (BMI) is a person's weight in kilograms divided by
    the square of their height in meters. BMI can be used to screen for
    weight categories such as underweight, normal, overweight, and obese
    that may lead to health problems. However, BMI is not diagnostic of
    the body fatness or health of an individual." The formula for
    computing BMI is</p>
    <div class="block formula"><var>bmi</var> = <div class="fract"><div>10,000 <var>weight</var></div><div><var>height</var><sup>2</sup></div></div></div>
    <p>where <var>weight</var> is in kilograms and <var>height</var> is
    in centimeters.</p>

    <p>Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the minimum number of calories
    required daily to keep your body functioning at rest. BMR is
    different for women and men and changes with age. The revised
    Harris-Benedict formulas for computing BMR are</p>
    <div class="block formula">(women) &nbsp;<var>bmr</var> = 447.593 + 9.247 <var>weight</var> + 3.098 <var>height</var> &minus; 4.330 <var>age</var></div>
    <div class="block formula">(men) &nbsp;<var>bmr</var> = 88.362 + 13.397 <var>weight</var> + 4.799 <var>height</var> &minus; 5.677 <var>age</var></div>
    <p>where <var>weight</var> is in kilograms and <var>height</var> is
    in centimeters.</p>

    <h2 id="l03_teach_assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>Work as a team to write a Python program named
    <code>fitness.py</code> that does the following:</p>

    <code>compute_age</code>, <code>kg_from_lb</code>,
    <code>cm_from_in</code>, <code>body_mass_index</code>, and
    <code>basal_metabloic_rate</code> functions. Finally the computer
    calls the <code>print</code> function which is the end of the
    program.</p>

    <code>kg_from_lb</code>, <code>cm_from_in</code>,
    <code>body_mass_index</code>, and
    <code>basal_metabolic_rate</code>. You also wrote code to call those
    six functions. Why is it important that you know how to write your
    own functions?</p>

    <h1>03 Prove Milestone: Writing Functions</h1>

    <h2 id="l03_prove_purpose">Purpose</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write functions with parameters and call those
    functions multiple times with arguments.</p>

    <h2 id="l03_prove_problem">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Modern computers are capable of performing all sorts of
    calculations to produce numbers. However, they are also capable of
    performing calculations to produce art, illustrations, animations,
    movies, and music.</p>

    <h2 id="l03_prove_assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>During this prove milestone and the next prove assignment, you
    will write a Python program that draws a semi-realistic outdoor
    scene in a computer window. Your program can draw any outdoor scene
    that you like as long as it meets these requirements:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>The scene must be outdoor and include part of the
        sky.</div></li>
        <li><div>The sky must have clouds.</div></li>
        <li><div>The scene must include repetitive objects, such as
        blades of grass, trees, leaves on a tree, birds, flowers,
        insects, fish, pickets in a fence, dashed lines on a road,
        buildings, bales of hay, snowmen, snowflakes, or
        icicles.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Your program must be divided into functions such as
    <code>draw_sky</code>, <code>draw_cloud</code>,
    <code>draw_ground</code>, <code>draw_bird</code>,
    <code>draw_flower</code>, <code>draw_insect</code>,
    <code>draw_fish</code>, or <code>draw_snowman</code>. Each of the
    objects in your scene should be drawn in its own function. To draw
    the shapes in the scene, your program will call functions in a
    Python library named Draw 2-D.</p>

    <p>During this milestone, you will write code that draws the sky,
    the ground, and clouds in your scene. During the next prove
    assignment, you will write code that completes your scene. As you
    write your program, write it so that it draws objects in the order
    of farthest away to nearest. For example, you program should draw
    the sky first, then clouds, then the ground, then trees, then
    insects in the trees. Be creative.</p>

    <h3 id="l03_prove_gallery">Scene Gallery</h3>
    <p>The following example scene was drawn by a student's Python
    program and fulfills the requirements of this assignment.</p>

    <h2 id="l03_prove_steps">Steps</h2>
    <p>Do the following:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Download the
        <a download href="draw2d/draw2d.py"><code>draw2d.py</code></a>
        file and save it in the same folder where you will save your
        program.</div></li>

        <li><div>Using VS Code, create a new file and copy and paste the
        following code into your new file. This beginning code imports
        the functions from the Draw 2-D library and creates a window and
        a canvas that your program will draw into.

<div class="pre" id="l03_prove_ex1"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Import the functions from the Draw 2-D library
# so that they can be used in this program.
from draw2d import \
    start_drawing, draw_line, draw_oval, draw_arc, \
    draw_rectangle, draw_polygon, draw_text, finish_drawing


def main():
    # Width and height of the scene in pixels
    scene_width = 800
    scene_height = 500

    # Call the start_drawing function in the draw2d.py
    # library which will open a window and create a canvas.
    canvas = start_drawing("Scene", scene_width, scene_height)

    # Call your drawing functions such
    # as draw_sky and draw_ground here.



    # Call the finish_drawing function
    # in the draw2d.py library.
    finish_drawing(canvas)


# Define your functions such as
# draw_sky and draw_ground here.



# Call the main function so that
# this program will start executing.
main()</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Save your new file as <code>scene.py</code> and run
        your new program. When you run it, it should open a window that
        contains an empty canvas as shown in the following figure.

        <figure class="full">

        alt="An empty canvas created by the Draw 2-D library"
        title="An empty canvas created by the Draw 2-D library"></figure>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Read the
        <a href="draw2d.html">documentation for the Draw 2-D library</a>.</div></li>

        <li><div>Starting at
        <span class="cross" data-ref="l03_prove_ex1">line&nbsp;31</span> of your

        <span class="cross" data-ref="l03_prove_ex1">line&nbsp;21</span>,
        write calls to your drawing functions.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="l03_prove_intent">Intent</h2>
    <p>The intent of this assignment is not to train you to become a
    world-famous cloud artist. Instead, the intent is to teach you how
    to apply the following principles to a real programming problem:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>Dividing a large program into functions</div></li>
        <li><div>Writing a function</div></li>
        <li><div>Deciding what needs to be a parameter in a function
        definition</div></li>
        <li><div>Calling a function with different argument values to
        produce different results</div></li>
        <li><div>Understanding how to separate the parts of a function
        that should stay the same and the parts that depend on
        parameters, in order to make the function as reusable as
        possible.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your program must be divided into functions such as
    <code>draw_sky</code>, <code>draw_cloud</code>,
    <code>draw_ground</code>, <code>draw_bird</code>,
    <code>draw_grass_blade</code>, or <code>draw_insect</code>. The
    headers for the <code>draw_sky</code>, <code>draw_ground</code>,
    and <code>draw_pine_tree</code> functions in the
    <a href="draw2d.html#ex1">example program</a> of the Draw 2-D
    documentation are good examples for the headers of all your draw_*
    functions. Below are a few other examples of headers for functions
    that you might want to include in your program. However, these are
    simply examples, and you can change them in your program or even
    exclude them from your program.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
def draw_house(canvas, house_left, house_bottom):

def draw_bird(canvas, bird_center, bird_top):

def draw_pebble(canvas, pebble_left, pebble_top, pebble_radius):

def draw_picket(canvas, picket_left, picket_bottom):

def draw_grass_blade(canvas, blade_left, blade_top, blade_height):</pre></div>

    <p>The following call graph shows the functions for a well-designed
    scene drawing program. From the call graph we see that this program
    is divided into small functions (<code>draw_sky</code>,
    <code>draw_ground</code>, <code>draw_sun</code>,
    <code>draw_cloud</code>, etc.). We see that the <code>main</code>
    function calls the <code>draw_sky</code> and
    <code>draw_ground</code> functions. The <code>draw_sky</code>
    function calls the <code>draw_sun</code>, <code>draw_cloud</code>,
    and <code>draw_bird</code> functions, and so on. This is a good
    design because each function is relatively small and performs just
    one task. Also, because the <code>draw_flower</code> function has
    parameters (not shown in the call graph), a programmer can write
    multiple calls to the <code>draw_flower</code> function, which will
    easily draw multiple flowers in different locations in his scene. The
    <code>draw_cloud</code>, <code>draw_bird</code>, and
    <code>draw_tree</code> functions also have parameters, and a
    programmer can write multiple calls to them, which will easily draw
    multiple clouds, birds, and trees in different locations. This is a
    good design.</p>

    <figure class="center callgraph" style="width:35em">

        the program is divided into small functions that each perform a
        single task, the program is well-designed.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The next call graph shows the functions for a different scene
    drawing program. Notice that this program isn't separated into small
    functions. Instead, all the code to draw an outdoor scene is inside
    the <code>main</code> function. The scene that this program draws
    may look very nice and have just as many objects as a well-designed
    program. However, the <code>main</code> function in this second
    program will be very long, complex, and confusing. This is a poor
    design.</p>

        <figcaption>The call graph for a poorly designed program.
        Because the program is not divided into small functions, the

        all the objects in the scene. The <code>main</code> function
        will be very long and confusing.</figcaption>

    <h1>Draw 2-D Library</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The Draw 2-D library contains functions that draw shapes on a
    canvas in a computer window. To use the Draw 2-D library, your
    program must do the following:</p>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Import the library's functions</div></li>

        <li><div>Call the <code>start_drawing</code> function once. The
        <code>start_drawing</code> function returns a canvas, that your
        program must pass to each of the <code>draw_*</code>
        functions.</div></li>

        <li><div>Call the <code>draw_line</code>, <code>draw_oval</code>,
        <code>draw_arc</code>, <code>draw_rectangle</code>,
        <code>draw_polygon</code>, and <code>draw_text</code> functions
        as many times as needed. The <code>draw_*</code> functions
        accept Euclidean coordinates that determine where a shape will
        be drawn on the canvas. The origin of the canvas
        <span class="nowrap">(0, 0)</span> is in the lower left corner
        of the canvas.</div></li>

        <li><div>Call the <code>finish_drawing</code> function
        once.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="l03_draw2d_examples">Examples</h2>
    <h3>Outdoor Scene Example</h3>
    <p>Example program&nbsp;1 contains all four of the steps needed to
    use the Draw 2-D library and draws an outdoor scene with two pine
    trees as shown in this image.</p>

    <figure class="full">

        alt="An outdoor scene drawn by the example program above."
        title="An outdoor scene drawn by the example program above.">
    </figure>

    <p>The computer draws the two pine trees because of the
    following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>The code at
        <span class="cross" data-ref="l03_draw2d_ex1">line&nbsp;90</span> calls
        the <code>main</code> function.</div></li>

        <li><div>At
        <span class="cross" data-ref="l03_draw2d_ex1">line&nbsp;20</span>, the
        <code>main</code> function calls the <code>draw_ground</code>
        function.</div></li>

        <li><div>At
        <span class="cross" data-ref="l03_draw2d_ex1">lines&nbsp;42 and&nbsp;49</span>,

    <h3>Row, Column, and Diagonal of Shapes</h3>
    <p>The program in example&nbsp;3 uses three <code>for</code> loops
    and the <code>draw_oval</code> function to draw circles in a row,
    a column, and a diagonal.</p>

    <figure class="center">

        title="A row, a column, and a diagonal of circles drawn by the example program above.">

    <p>Comparing the three <code>for</code> loops at lines
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l03_draw2d_ex3">17&ndash;20</span>,
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l03_draw2d_ex3">25&ndash;28</span>, and
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l03_draw2d_ex3">33&ndash;37</span>
    will help you understand how you can use a <code>for</code> loop to
    draw many shapes. Of course, your program can call any draw function
    within a <code>for</code> loop and draw any shape you like.</p>

    <h3>Rectangular Group of Shapes</h3>
    <p>The program in example&nbsp;4 uses two <code>for</code> loops and
    the <code>draw_oval</code> function to draw a rectangular group of
    circles.</p>

    <figure class="center">
        <img src="../lesson03/draw2d/rectangular.png" width="602"
        alt="A rectangular series of circles drawn by the example program above."
        title="A rectangular series of circles drawn by the example program above.">
    </figure>

    <p>The first <code>for</code> loop starts at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l03_draw2d_ex4">line&nbsp;16</span>
    The second <code>for</code> loop is nested inside the first at
    lines&nbsp;<span class="cross" data-ref="l03_draw2d_ex4">18&ndash;21</span>. The
    computer executes the first <code>for</code> loop once for each row
    in the group. The computer executes the second <code>for</code> loop
    once for each cell in the group. Because the loops are nested, the
    computer executes the statements inside the second loop at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l03_draw2d_ex4">lines&nbsp;19&ndash;21</span>
    120&nbsp;times <span class="nowrap">(6 &times; 20)</span>. In other
    words, the program in example&nbsp;4 will draw six rows with 20
    circles in each row, which makes 120 circles.</p>

    <h3>Randomly Located Shapes</h3>
    <p>The program in example&nbsp;5 draws a row of circles but some of
    the circles are missing because the computer randomly chose not to
    draw some of the circles. It also draws 100 circles, each with a
    random diameter at a randomly chosen location.</p>

    <figure class="center">
        <img src="../lesson03/draw2d/random.png" width="602"
        alt="Circles drawn by the example program above."
        title="Circles drawn by the example program above.">
    </figure>

    <p>In example&nbsp;5 at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l03_draw2d_ex5">line&nbsp;24</span>,
    the call to the
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randint"><code>random.randint</code></a>
    function causes the computer to calculate a random number between 1
    and 5 inclusive. The <code>if</code> statement at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l03_draw2d_ex5">line&nbsp;25</span> allows the
    computer to draw a circle if the random number is greater
    than&nbsp;1. In other words, if the random number is&nbsp;1, the
    computer will not draw a circle, which means about 20%
    <span class="nowrap">(1 / 5)</span> of the circles in the row will
    not be drawn.</p>

    <p>In example&nbsp;5, the statements at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l03_draw2d_ex5">lines&nbsp;36&ndash;41</span>,
    cause the computer to draw 100 circles, each with a random location
    and diameter. At
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l03_draw2d_ex5">lines&nbsp;37&ndash;39</span>,
    the computer calculates a random location (<var>x</var> and
    <var>y</var>) and a random diameter. Then at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l03_draw2d_ex5">lines&nbsp;40&ndash;41</span>
    the computer uses those random numbers to draw a circle.</p>

    <h1>04 Prepare: Function Details</h1>
    <p>During this lesson, you will learn additional details about
    writing and calling functions. These details include variable scope,
    default parameter values, and optional arguments and will help you
    understand functions better and write them more effectively.</p>

    <h2 id="l04_prepare_var_scope">Variable Scope</h2>
    <p>The <dfn>scope</dfn> of a variable determines how long that
    variable exists and where it can be used. Within a Python program,
    there are two categories of scope: local and global. A variable has
    <dfn>local scope</dfn> when it is defined (assigned a value) inside
    a function. A variable has <dfn>global scope</dfn> when it is
    defined outside of all functions. Here is a small Python program
    that has two variables: <var>g</var> and <var>x</var>. <var>g</var>
    is defined outside of all functions and therefore has global scope.
    <var>x</var> is defined inside the <code>main</code> function and
    therefore has local scope.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l04_prepare_ex1"><pre class="python">
<span data-scope="global"># g is a global variable because it
# is defined outside of all functions.
<span class="varDef">g</span> = 25

<span data-scope="main">def main():
    # x is a local variable because
    # it is defined inside a function.
    <span class="varDef">x</span> = 1</span></span></pre></div>

    <p>As shown in the following table, a local variable (a variable
    with local scope) is defined inside a function, exists for as long
    as its containing function is executing, and can be used within its
    containing function but nowhere else. A global variable (a variable
    with global scope) is defined outside all functions, exists for as
    long as its containing Python program is executing, and can be used
    within all functions in its containing Python program.</p>

    <table><thead>
        <tr><th style="min-width:8em"></th>
            <th colspan="2">Python Variable Scope</th></tr>
        <tr><td></td> <th scope="col">Local</th>
            <th scope="col">Global</th></tr>
    </thead><tbody>
        <tr><th scope="row">Where to Define</th>
            <td>Inside a function</td>
            <td>Outside all functions</td></tr>
        <tr><th scope="row">Owner</th>
            <td>The function where the variable is defined</td>
            <td>The Python file where the variable is defined</td></tr>
        <tr><th scope="row">Lifetime</th>
            <td>Only as long as its containing function is
            executing</td>
            <td>As long as its containing program is executing</td></tr>
        <tr><th scope="row">Where Usable</th>
            <td>Only inside the function where it is defined</td>
            <td>In all functions of the Python program</td></tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p>The following Python code example contains parameters and
    variables. Parameters have local scope because they are defined
    within a function, specifically within a function’s header and exist
    for as long as their containing function is executing. The variable
    <var>nShapes</var> is global because it is defined outside of all
    functions. Because it is a global variable, the code in the body of
    all functions may use the variable <var>nShapes</var>. Within the
    <code>square_area</code> function, the parameter named
    <var>length</var> and the variable named <var>area</var> both have
    local scope. Within the <code>rectangle_area</code> function, the
    parameters named <var>width</var> and <var>length</var> and the
    variable named <var>area</var> have local scope.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l04_prepare_ex2"><pre class="python">
<span data-scope="global"><span class="varDef">nShapes</span> = 0

<span data-scope="square">def square_area(<span class="varDef">length</span>):
    <span class="varDef">area</span> = <span class="varUse">length</span> * <span class="varUse">length</span>
    return <span class="varUse">area</span></span>

<span data-scope="rect">def rectangle_area(<span class="varDef">width</span>, <span class="varDef">length</span>):
    <span class="varDef">area</span> = <span class="varUse">width</span> * <span class="varUse">length</span>
    return <span class="varUse">area</span></span></span></pre></div>

    <p>Because local variables are visible only within the function
    where they are defined, a programmer can define two variables with
    the same name as long as he defines them in different functions. In
    the previous example, both of the <code>square_area</code> and
    <code>rectangle_area</code> functions contain a parameter named
    <var>length</var> and a variable named <var>area</var>. All four of
    these variables are entirely separate and do not conflict with each
    other in any way because the scope of each variable is local to the
    function where it is defined.</p>

    <h3 id="l04_prepare_scope_mistake">Common Mistake</h3>
    <p>A common mistake that many programmers make is to assume that a
    local variable can be used inside other functions. For example, the
    Python program in example&nbsp;3 includes two functions named
    <code>main</code> and <code>circle_area</code>.
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l04_prepare_ex3">Line&nbsp;6</span>
    in <code>main</code> defines a variable named <var>radius</var>.
    Some programmers assume that the variable <var>radius</var> that is
    defined in <code>main</code> (and is therefore local to
    <code>main</code> only) can be used in the <code>circle_area</code>
    function. However, local variables from one function cannot be used
    inside another function. The local variables from <code>main</code>
    cannot be used inside <code>circle_area</code>.</p>

    <span class="varDef">area</span> = circle_area()
    print(f"area: {<span class="varUse">area</span>:.1f}")</span>

<span data-scope="circle_area">def circle_area():
    # Mistake! There is no variable named radius
    # defined inside this function, so the variable
    # radius cannot be used in this function.
    <span class="varDef">area</span> = <span class="varUse">math</span>.pi * <em><span class="varUse">radius</span></em> * <em><span class="varUse">radius</span></em>
    return <span class="varUse">area</span></span>

    <h2 id="l04_prepare_default_params">Default Parameter Values and Optional
    Arguments</h2>
    <p>Python allows function parameters to have default values. If a
    parameter has a default value, then its corresponding argument is
    optional. If a function is called without an argument, the
    corresponding parameter gets its default value.</p>

    <p>Consider the program in example&nbsp;5. Notice at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l04_prepare_ex5">line&nbsp;19</span>
    in the header for the <code>arc_length</code> function, that the
    parameter <var>radius</var> does not have a default value but the
    parameter <var>degrees</var> has a default value of 360. This means
    that when a programmer writes code to call the
    <code>arc_length</code> function, the programmer must pass a value
    for <var>radius</var> but is not required to pass a value for
    <var>degrees</var>. At
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l04_prepare_ex5">line&nbsp;8</span>, the
    programmer wrote code to call the <code>arc_length</code> function
    and passed 4.7 for the <var>radius</var> parameter but did not pass
    a value for the <var>degrees</var>, so during that call to
    <code>arc_length</code>, the value of <var>degrees</var> will be the
    default value from
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l04_prepare_ex5">line&nbsp;19</span>, which is
    360. At <span class="cross" data-ref="l04_prepare_ex5">line&nbsp;13</span>, the
    programmer wrote code to call the <code>arc_length</code> function
    again and passed two arguments: 4.7 and 270, so during that call to
    <code>arc_length</code>, the value of <var>degrees</var> will be
    270.</p>

    <h2 id="l04_prepare_func_design">Function Design</h2>
    <p>What are the properties of a good function?</p>

    <p>There are many things to consider when writing a function, and
    many authors have written about design concepts that make functions
    easier to understand and less error prone. In future courses at
    BYU-Idaho, you will study some of these design concepts. For
    CSE&nbsp;111, the following list contains a few properties that you
    should incorporate into your functions.</p>

    <ul class="long">
        <li><div>A good function is understandable by other programmers.
        One way to make a function understandable is to write a
        documentation string at the top of the function that describes
        the function, its parameters, and its return value. Another way
        to make a function understandable is to write comments in the
        body of the function as needed.</div></li>

        <li><div>A good function performs a single task that the
        programmer can describe, and the function's name matches its
        task.</div></li>

        <li><div>A good function is relatively short, perhaps fewer than
        20 lines of code.</div></li>

        <li><div>A good function has as few decision points
        (<code>if</code> statements and loops) as possible. Too many
        decision points in a function make a function error prone and
        difficult to test.</div></li>

        <li><div>A good function is as reusable as possible. Functions
        that use parameters and return a result are more reusable than
        functions that get input from a user and print results to a
        terminal window.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>As you read the sample code in CSE&nbsp;111, observe how the
    sample functions fit these good properties, and as you write
    programs for CSE&nbsp;111, do your best to write functions that have
    these good properties.</p>

    <h2 id="l04_prepare_summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>During this lesson, you are studying variable scope, default
    parameter values, and optional arguments. A variable that is defined
    (assigned a value) inside a function has local scope, and it can be
    used inside only the function where it is defined. Parameters always
    have local scope.</p>

    <p>A parameter may have a default value like the parameter
    <var>degrees</var> in this function header:</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">def arc_length(radius, degrees=360):
    &vellip;</pre></div>

    <p>When a function's parameter has a default value, you can write a
    call to that function without passing an argument for the parameter
    like this:</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">length = arc_length(3.5)</pre></div>
    <p>In other words, the argument for a parameter that has a default
    value is optional.</p>

    that the <code>cone_volume</code> function could use the

    in the <code>main</code> function. Of course, this assumption is
    incorrect because as the

    <code>cone_volume</code> function. However, the <var>radius</var>
    and <var>height</var> variables are defined inside the
    <code>main</code> function and therefore have local scope and cannot
    be used outside of <code>main</code>. To fix the program, you added
    two parameters to the <code>cone_volume</code> function and then
    added two arguments to each call of the <code>cone_volume</code>
    function.</p>

    <p>Why was local variable scope invented by computer scientists? How
    does local variable scope make a program easier to write and

    <h1>04 Team Activity: Writing Functions</h1>

    <h2 id="l04_teach_instrucs">Instructions</h2>
    <p>Each lesson in CSE 111 contains a team activity that is designed
    to take about one hour to complete. You should prepare for all team
    activities by completing the preparation material and the individual
    checkpoint assignment before starting a team activity. The goal of
    the team activities is for students to work together and teach and
    learn from each other. As your team completes a team activity,
    instead of moving through it as quickly as you can, you should help
    everyone understand the concepts.</p>

    <h3>Face-to-Face Students</h3>
    <p>Face-to-face students will complete the team activities in their
    classroom during class time.</p>

    <h3>Online Students in a Semester Section</h3>
    <p>Online students in a semester section will arrange and
    participate in a one hour synchronous video meeting with your team
    for each team activity. As your team works through the assignment,
    be certain that each student can see the code that is being typed.
    When your team completes the video meeting, share the final Python
    file with everyone on your team.</p>

    <h3>Online Students in a Block Section</h3>
    <p>Students in a block section complete two lessons each week. This
    means that online students in a block section will complete two team
    activities each week. For one of these two activities, your team
    should arrange and participate in a one hour synchronous video
    meeting. For the other team activity, your team may meet in a
    synchronous video meeting or your team may collaborate, ask and
    answer questions, and share code in Microsoft Teams.</p>

    <p>As your team works through a team assignment in a synchronous
    video meeting, be certain that each student can see the code that is
    being typed. When your team completes the video meeting, share the
    final Python file with everyone on your team.</p>

    <h2 id="l04_teach_purpose">Purpose</h2>
    <p>Strengthen your understanding of user-defined functions,
    parameters, arguments, and local variable scope by writing a program
    that has three or more functions.</p>

    <h2 id="l04_teach_problem">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>In many countries, food is stored in steel cans (also known as
    tin cans) that are shaped like cylinders. There are many different
    sizes of steel cans. The <dfn>storage efficiency</dfn> of a can
    tells us how much a can stores versus how much steel is required to
    make the can. Some sizes of cans require a lot of steel to store a
    small amount of food. Other sizes of cans require less steel and
    store more food. A can size with a large storage efficiency is
    considered more friendly to the environment than a can size with a
    small storage efficiency.</p>

    <p>The storage efficiency of a steel can is computed by dividing the
    volume of a can by its surface area.</p>

    <div class="block formula"><var>storage_efficiency</var> = <div class="fract"><div><var>volume</var></div><div><var>surface_area</var></div></div></div>

    <p>In other words, the storage efficiency of a can is the space
    inside the can divided by the amount of steel required to make the
    can. The formulas for the volume and surface area of a cylinder
    are:</p>

    <div class="block formula"><var>volume</var> = &pi;&thinsp;<var>radius</var><sup>2</sup>&thinsp;<var>height</var></div>
    <div class="block formula"><var>surface_area</var> = 2&pi;&thinsp;<var>radius</var>&thinsp;(<var>radius</var> + <var>height</var>)</div>

    <ul>
        <li><div>&pi; is the constant PI, the ratio of the circumference
        of a circle divided by its diameter (use
        <code>math.pi</code>)</div></li>
        <li><div><var>radius</var> is the radius of the cylinder</div></li>
        <li><div><var>height</var> is the height of the cylinder</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you separate your program into functions, this problem will be
    much easier to solve than if you don't separate it into functions.
    You are free to write any functions that you choose in your program,
    but we <em>strongly</em> suggest that your program include at least
    these three functions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><div><code>main</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>compute_volume</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>compute_surface_area</code></div></li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="l04_teach_required">Core Requirements</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Your program must compute the volume of all 12 can
        sizes.</div></li>
        <li><div>Your program must compute the surface area of all 12
        can sizes.</div></li>
        <li><div>Your program must compute and print the storage
        efficiency of all 12 can sizes.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="l04_teach_stretch">Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an hour,
    complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that the
    stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Add another function named
        <code>compute_storage_efficiency</code> to your program. This
        function should call the <code>compute_volume</code>
        and <code>compute_surface_area</code> functions and
        then compute and return the storage efficiency of a steel can
        size. Replace code in the <code>main</code> function with a call
        to the <code>compute_storage_efficiency</code> function as
        appropriate. Did adding and calling the
        <code>compute_storage_efficiency</code> function reduce the
        number of lines of code in your program?</div></li>

        <li><div>The table of can sizes that appears in the Assignment
        section above includes a column that contains the cost per can
        of each steel can size. Add another function to your program
        named <code>compute_cost_efficiency</code> that computes and
        returns the volume of a steel can divided by its cost. Write
        code to call the <code>compute_cost_efficiency</code> function
        and print the cost efficiency for each can size. Then visually
        examine the output and answer this question, "Which can size has
        the highest cost efficiency?"</div></li>

        <li><div>If you remember how to use lists and a for loop from
        CSE&nbsp;110, rewrite your <code>main</code> function so that it
        uses a list or lists that contain the can size names and
        dimensions. Then write a loop that processes the values in the
        list.</div></li>

        <li><div>Add <code>if</code> statements inside the loop to
        automatically determine which can size has the best storage
        efficiency and which can size has the best cost
        efficiency.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="l04_teach_testing">Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="testing">
        <li><div>Run your program and verify that it prints the correct
        results, rounded and formatted as shown below.

<pre class="console">&gt; python can_sizes.py
#1 Picnic 2.04
#1 Tall 2.35

#211 2.20
#300 2.27
#303 2.34</pre>
        </div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="l04_teach_solution">Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your solution to the
    <a class="solution" href="teach_solution.py">sample solution</a>
    or the
    <a class="solution" href="teach_stretch.py">stretch solution</a>.
    Please <strong>do not look at the sample solution</strong> until you
    have either finished the program or diligently worked for at least
    one hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling to
    complete the assignment, you may use the sample solution to help you
    finish.</p>

    <h3 id="l04_teach_call_graph">Call Graph</h3>
    <p>The following call graph shows the function calls and returns in
    the sample solution for this assignment. From this call graph we see
    that the computer starts executing the sample program by calling the
    <code>main</code> function. While executing the <code>main</code>
    function, the computer calls the <code>compute_volume</code>,
    <code>compute_surface_area</code>, and <code>print</code>
    functions.</p>

        title="A function call graph for this assignment">
    </figure>

    <h2 id="l04_teach_ponder">Ponder</h2>
    <p>After you finish this assignment, congratulate yourself because
    you wrote a Python program with at least three user-defined
    functions. As you wrote your program, what did you learn about
    organizing a program into functions?</p>

    <h2 id="l04_teach_submit">Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>

    <h1>04 Prove Assignment: Writing Functions</h1>

    <h2 id="l04_prove_purpose">Purpose</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write functions with parameters and call those
    functions multiple times with arguments.</p>

    <h2 id="l04_prove_problem">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Modern computers are capable of performing all sorts of
    calculations to produce numbers. However, they are also capable of
    performing calculations to produce art, illustrations, animations,
    movies, and music.</p>

    <h2 id="l04_prove_assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>During the previous lesson's milestone, you wrote code to draw at
    least the sky, clouds, and ground of an outdoor scene. During this
    lesson, you will write code that draws the remaining objects in your
    scene. Your program can draw any outdoor scene that you like as long
    as it meets these requirements:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>The scene must be outdoor and include part of the
        sky.</div></li>
        <li><div>The sky must have clouds.</div></li>
        <li><div>The scene must include repetitive objects, such as
        blades of grass, trees, leaves on a tree, birds, flowers,
        insects, fish, pickets in a fence, dashed lines on a road,
        buildings, bales of hay, snowmen, snowflakes, or
        icicles.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Your program must be divided into functions such as
    <code>draw_sky</code>, <code>draw_cloud</code>,
    <code>draw_ground</code>, <code>draw_bird</code>,
    <code>draw_flower</code>, <code>draw_insect</code>,
    <code>draw_fish</code>, or <code>draw_snowman</code>. Each
    repetitive object in your scene should be drawn by a function that
    your program calls repeatedly, once for each repeated object. For
    example, your program could include a function named
    <code>draw_leaf</code> that your program repeatedly calls to draw
    each leaf on a tree at a different location.</p>

    <p>As you write your program, write it so that it draws objects in
    the order of farthest away to nearest. For example, you program
    should draw the sky first, then clouds, then the ground, then trees,
    then insects in the trees. Be creative.</p>

    <h2 id="l04_prove_testing">Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="test">
        <li><div>Run your program and verify that it correctly opens a
        window and draws within that window a complete outdoor scene
        that contains the sky, clouds, the ground, and other
        elements.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="l04_prove_exceed">Exceeding the Requirements</h2>
    <p>If your program fulfills the requirements for this assignment as
    described in the previous prove milestone and the Assignment section
    above, your program will earn 93% of the possible points. In order
    to earn the remaining 7% of points, you will need to write your
    drawing functions so that they correctly use parameters.</p>

    <p>Consider the following <code>draw_pine_trees</code> function that
    draws three trees. It correctly draws three trees. However, it has
    only one parameter (<var>canvas</var>) but should have more. With
    only one parameter, the <code>draw_pine_trees</code> function is not
    easily reusable because it uses hard coded numbers for the
    coordinates at lines <span class="cross" data-ref="l04_prove_ex1">5,&nbsp;6,
    10,&nbsp;11, 15,&nbsp;and&nbsp;16</span>. Because of the way that
    the <code>draw_pine_trees</code> function is written, it can draw
    only three pine trees, and it will always draw them at the same
    locations. What if we decide to change the width and height of the
    scene? The <code>draw_pine_trees</code> function will draw pine
    trees in the same locations as before, but these may be the wrong
    locations in a larger scene.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l04_prove_ex1"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python">def draw_pine_trees(canvas):
    """Draw three pine trees, each at a fixed location."""

    # Draw a tree.
    draw_rectangle(canvas, 300, 70, 320, 120, fill="brown")
    draw_polygon(canvas, 240, 110, 310, 320, 380, 110,
            fill="forestGreen")

    # Draw another tree.
    draw_rectangle(canvas, 200, 60, 220, 110, fill="brown")
    draw_polygon(canvas, 140, 100, 210, 310, 280, 100,
            fill="forestGreen")

    # Draw a third tree.
    draw_rectangle(canvas, 100, 50, 120, 100, fill="brown")
    draw_polygon(canvas, 40, 90, 110, 300, 180, 90,
            fill="forestGreen")</pre>
</div>

    <p>Now consider the <code>draw_pine_tree</code> function in the next
    example. Notice that the <code>draw_pine_tree</code> function has
    more parameters than the <code>draw_pine_trees</code> function in
    the previous example. The two extra parameters (<var>peak_x</var>
    and <var>peak_y</var>) deteremine where the
    <code>draw_pine_tree</code> function will draw one tree. These two
    parameters (<var>peak_x</var> and <var>peak_y</var>) make the
    <code>draw_pine_tree</code> function more reusable than the
    <code>draw_pine_trees</code> function in the previous example.
    Notice at <span class="cross" data-ref="l04_prove_ex2">lines 30&ndash;34</span>,
    that the <code>main</code> function reuses (calls) the
    <code>draw_pine_tree</code> function five times.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l04_prove_ex2"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python">def draw_pine_tree(canvas, peak_x, peak_y):
    """Draw one pine tree at location (peak_x, peak_y)"""

    # Compute the coordinates of the skirt and trunk.
    skirt_left  = peak_x - 70
    skirt_right = peak_x + 70
    skirt_bottom = peak_y - 210
    trunk_left  = peak_x - 10
    trunk_right = peak_x + 10
    trunk_bottom = peak_y - 260

    # Draw the tree trunk.
    draw_rectangle(canvas, trunk_left, trunk_bottom,
            trunk_right, skirt_bottom, fill="brown")

    # Draw the tree skirt.
    draw_polygon(canvas, skirt_left, skirt_bottom, peak_x, peak_y,
            skirt_right, skirt_bottom, fill="forestGreen")


def main():
    # Width and height of the scene in pixels
    scene_width = 800
    scene_height = 500

    # Call the start_drawing function in the draw2d.py
    # library which will open a window and create a canvas.
    canvas = start_drawing("Scene", scene_width, scene_height)

    draw_pine_tree(canvas, 240, 320)
    draw_pine_tree(canvas, 160, 280)
    draw_pine_tree(canvas, 100, 250)
    draw_pine_tree(canvas, 500, 350)
    draw_pine_tree(canvas, 600, 280)

    # Call the finish_drawing function
    # in the draw2d.py library.
    finish_drawing(canvas)</pre>
</div>

    <p>In summary, if you wish to earn the last 7% of points for this
    assignment, you must write your drawing functions to have and use
    parameters like the <code>draw_pine_tree</code> function in the
    second example above.</p>

    <h2 id="l04_prove_ponder">Ponder</h2>
    <p>After you finish this assignment, congratulate yourself because
    you wrote a Python program with many user-defined functions. As you
    wrote your program, what did you learn about organizing a program
    into functions? Did you learn that you can work more efficiently by
    writing a function once and calling it many times with different
    arguments?</p>

    <h2 id="l04_prove_submit">Submission</h2>
    <p>To submit your program, return to I-Learn and do these two
    things:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Upload your program (the .py file) for feedback.</div></li>
        <li><div>Add a submission comment that specifies the grading
        category that best describes your program along with a one or

<section>
    <h1>05 Prepare: Testing Functions</h1>
    <p>During this lesson, you will learn to use a more systematic
    approach to developing code. Specifically, you will learn how to
    write test functions that automatically verify that program
    functions are correct. You will learn how to use a Python module
    named <code>pytest</code> to run your test functions, and you will
    learn how to read the output of <code>pytest</code> to help you find
    and fix mistakes in your code.</p>

    <h2 id="l05_prepare_concepts">Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn during this lesson:</p>

    <h3 id="l05_prepare_ineff_test">Inefficient Testing</h3>
    <p>During previous lessons, you tested your programs by running
    them, typing user input, reading the program's output, and verifying
    that the output was correct. This is a valid way to test a program.
    However, it is time consuming, tedious, and error prone. A much
    better way to test a program is to test its functions individually
    and to write separate <dfn>test functions</dfn> that
    <em>automatically</em> verify that the program's functions are
    correct.</p>

    <p>In this course, you will write test functions in a Python file
    that is separate from your Python program. In other words, you will
    keep normal program code and test code in separate
    files.</p>

    <h3 id="l05_prepare_assert">Assert Statements</h3>
    <p>In a computer program, an <dfn>assertion</dfn> is a statement
    that causes the computer to check if a comparison is true. When the
    computer checks the comparison, if the comparison is true, the
    computer will continue to execute the code in the program. However,
    if the comparison is false, the computer will raise an
    <code>AssertionError</code>, which will likely cause the program to
    terminate. (In <a href="../lesson10/prepare.html">lesson&nbsp;10</a>
    you will learn how to write code to handle errors so that a program
    won't terminate when the computer raises an error.)</p>

    <p>A programmer writes assertions in a program to inform the
    computer of comparisons that must be true in order for the program
    to run successfully. The Python keyword to write an assertion is
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-assert-statement"><code>assert</code></a>.
    Imagine a program used by a bank to track account balances,
    deposits, and withdrawals. A programmer might write the first few
    lines of the <code>deposit</code> function like this:</p>

<div class="pre" id="l05_prepare_ex1"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python">
def deposit(amount):
    # In order for this program to work correctly and
    # for the bank records to be correct, we must not
    # allow someone to deposit a zero or negative amount.
    assert amount &gt; 0
      &vellip;</pre>
</div>

    <p>The <code>assert</code> statement at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l05_prepare_ex1">line&nbsp;5</span> in the
    previous example will cause the computer to check if the
    <var>amount</var> is greater than zero (0). If the <var>amount</var>
    is greater than zero, the computer will continue to execute the
    program. However, if the <var>amount</var> is zero or less
    (negative), the computer will raise an <code>AssertionError</code>,
    which will likely cause the program to terminate.</p>

    <p>A programmer can write any valid Python comparison in an
    <code>assert</code> statement. Here are a few examples from various
    unrelated programs:</p>

<div class="pre" id="l05_prepare_ex2"><pre class="python">
    assert temperature &lt; 0

    assert len(given_name) &gt; 0

    assert balance == 0

    assert school_year != "senior"</pre></div>

    <h3 id="l05_prepare_pytest">The pytest Module</h3>
    <p><a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference/reference.html"><code>pytest</code></a>
    is a third-party Python module that makes it easy to write and run
    test functions. There are other Python testing modules besides
    <code>pytest</code>, but <code>pytest</code> seems to be the easiest
    to use. <code>pytest</code> is not a standard Python module. It is a
    third-party module. This means that when you installed Python on
    your computer, <code>pytest</code> was not installed, and you will
    need to install <code>pytest</code> in order to use it. During the
    checkpoint of this lesson, you will use a standard Python module
    named <code>pip</code> to install <code>pytest</code>.</p>

    <p><code>pytest</code> allows a programmer to write simple test
    functions that use the Python <code>assert</code> statement to
    verify that a function returns a correct result. For example, if we
    want to verify that the built-in <code>min</code> function works
    correctly, we could write a test function like this:</p>

<div class="pre" id="l05_prepare_ex3"><pre class="python">def test_min():
    assert min(7, -3, 0, 2) == -3</pre></div>

    <p>In the previous function, the assert statement will cause the
    computer to first call the <code>min</code> function and pass 7,
    &minus;3, 0, and 2 as arguments to the <code>min</code> function.
    The <code>min</code> function will find the minimum value of its
    parameters and return that minimum value. Then the
    <code>assert</code> statement will compare the returned minimum
    value to &minus;3. If the returned value is not &minus;3, the
    <code>assert</code> statement will raise an exception which will
    cause <code>pytest</code> to print an error message.</p>

    <h3 id="l05_prepare_compare_floats">Comparing Floating Point Numbers</h3>
    <p>Within a computer's memory, everything (all numbers, text, sound,
    pictures, movies, everything) is stored using the binary number
    system. While executing a Python program, a computer stores integers
    in binary in a way that exactly represents the integers. For
    example, a computer stores the integer 23 as 00010111 in binary
    which is an exact representation of decimal 23. However, a computer
    approximates floating point numbers (numbers with digits after the
    decimal place). For example, while executing a Python program, a
    computer stores the floating point number 23.7 as binary
    0100000000110111101100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011.
    This binary number is actually 23.69999999999999928945726424 in
    decimal which is an approximation to 23.7</p>
    <!--
    // Java
    double number = 23.7;
    System.out.println(number);
    System.out.println(Long.toHexString(Double.doubleToLongBits(number)));
    System.out.println(Long.toBinaryString(Double.doubleToLongBits(number)));

    0x4037b33333333333
    0100000000110111101100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011

    # Python
    from decimal import Decimal
    number = 23.7
    print(Decimal(number).as_tuple())

    DecimalTuple(sign=0, digits=(2, 3, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 2, 8, 9, 4, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4, 2, 3, 9, 8, 9, 9, 8, 1, 4, 1, 2, 8, 8, 7, 5, 7, 3, 2, 4, 2, 1, 8, 7, 5), exponent=-48)
    23.699999999999999289457264239899814128875732421875
    -->

    <p>Because computers approximate floating point numbers, we must
    carefully compare floating point numbers in our test functions. It
    is bad practice to check if floating point numbers are equal using
    just the equality operator (==). The <code>pytest</code> module
    contains a function named
    <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference/reference.html#pytest-approx"><code>approx</code></a>
    to help us compare floating point numbers. For example, to test the
    <code>math.sqrt</code> function, we could write a test function like
    this:</p>

<div class="pre" id="l05_prepare_ex4"><pre class="python">def test_sqrt():
    assert math.sqrt(5) == approx(2.24, 0.01)</pre></div>

    <p>The <code>assert</code> statement in the previous test function
    verifies that the value returned from <code>math.sqrt(5)</code> is
    within 1% (0.01) of 2.24.</p>

    <h3 id="l05_prepare_test_func">How to Test a Function</h3>
    <p>To test a function you should do the following:</p>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Write a function that is part of your normal Python
        program.</div></li>
        <li><div>Think about different parameter values that will cause
        the computer to execute all the code in your function and will
        possibly cause your function to fail or return an incorrect
        result.</div></li>
        <li><div>In a separate Python file, write a test function that
        calls your program function and uses an <code>assert</code>
        statement to <em>automatically</em> verify that the value
        returned from your program function is correct.</div></li>
        <li><div>Use <code>pytest</code> to run the test
        function.</div></li>
        <li><div>Read the output of <code>pytest</code> and use that
        output to help you find and fix mistakes in both your program
        function and test function.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h4 id="l05_prepare_example">Example</h4>
    <p>Below is a simple function named <code>cels_from_fahr</code> that
    converts a temperature in Fahrenheit to Celsius and returns the
    Celsius temperature. The <code>cels_from_fahr</code> function is
    part of a larger Python program in a file named
    <code>weather.py</code>.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l05_prepare_ex5"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># weather.py

def cels_from_fahr(fahr):
    """Convert a temperature in Fahrenheit to
    Celsius and return the Celsius temperature.

    return cels</pre></div>

    <p>We want to test the <code>cels_from_fahr</code> function. From
    the function header at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l05_prepare_ex5">line&nbsp;3</span> in
    <code>weather.py</code>, we see that <code>cels_from_fahr</code>
    takes one parameter named <var>fahr</var>. To adequately test this
    function, we should call it at least three times with the following
    arguments.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><div>a negative number</div></li>
        <li><div>zero</div></li>
        <li><div>a positive number</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>In a separate file named <code>test_weather.py</code> we write a
    test function named <code>test_cels_from_fahr</code> as follows:</p>

<div class="pre" id="l05_prepare_ex6"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># test_weather.py

from weather import cels_from_fahr
from pytest import approx
import pytest

def <em>test_cels_from_fahr()</em>:
    """Test the cels_from_fahr function by calling it and
    comparing the values it returns to the expected values.
    Notice this test function uses pytest.approx to compare
    floating point numbers.
    """
    assert cels_from_fahr(-25) == approx(-31.66667)
    assert cels_from_fahr(0) == approx(-17.77778)
    assert cels_from_fahr(32) == approx(0)
    assert cels_from_fahr(70) == approx(21.1111)

# Call the main function that is part of pytest so that the
# computer will execute the test functions in this file.
pytest.main(["-v", "--tb=line", "-rN", __file__])</pre></div>

    <p>Notice in <code>test_weather.py</code> at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l05_prepare_ex6">lines&nbsp;13&ndash;16</span>
    that the test function
    <code>test_cels_from_fahr</code>
    calls the program function <code>cels_from_fahr</code> four
    times: once with a negative number, once with zero, and twice with
    positive numbers. Notice also that the test function uses
    <code>assert</code> and <code>approx</code>.</p>

    <p>After writing the test function, we use <code>pytest</code> to
    run the test function. At
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l05_prepare_ex6">line&nbsp;20</span>,
    instead of writing a call to the <code>main</code> function, as we
    do in program files, we write a call to the <code>pytest.main</code>
    fnction. In CSE&nbsp;111, at the bottom of all test files, we will
    write a call to <code>pytest.main</code> exactly as shown on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l05_prepare_ex6">line&nbsp;20</span>. This call to
    <code>pytest.main</code> will cause the <code>pytest</code> module
    to run our test functions. When <code>pytest</code> runs our test
    functions, it will produce output that tells us if the tests passed
    or failed like this:</p>

<pre class="console">&gt; python test_weather.py
===================== test session starts ======================

<span class="pass">====================== 1 passed in 0.10s =======================</span></pre>

    <p>As shown above, <code>pytest</code> runs the
    <code>test_cels_from_fahr</code> function which calls the
    <code>cels_from_fahr</code> function four times and verifies that
    <code>cels_from_fahr</code> returns the correct value each time. We
    can see from the output of <code>pytest</code>, "PASSED [100%]" and
    "1&nbsp;passed", that the <code>cels_from_fahr</code> function
    returned the expected (correct) result all four times.</p>

    <h3 id="l05_prepare_separate">Separating Program Code from Test Code</h3>
    <p>In CSE&nbsp;111, we will write test functions in a file separate
    from program functions. It is a good idea to separate test functions
    and program functions because the separation makes it easy to
    release a program to users without releasing the test functions to
    them. In general, users of a program don't want the test functions.
    One consequence of writing program functions and test functions in
    separate files is that we must add an import statement at the top of
    the test file that imports all the program functions that will be
    tested.</p>

    <p><span class="cross" data-ref="l05_prepare_ex6">Line&nbsp;3</span> from
    <code>test_weather.py</code> above is an example of an import
    statement that imports functions from a program file. Line&nbsp;3
    matches this template:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">from <var>file_name</var> import <var>function_1</var>, <var>function_2</var>, &hellip; <var>function_N</var></pre></div>

    <p>When the computer imports functions from a file, the computer
    immediately executes all statements that are not written inside a
    function. This includes the statement to call the <code>main</code>
    function:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
# Start this program by
# calling the main function.
main()</pre></div>

    <p>This means that when we run our test functions, the computer will
    import our program functions and at the same time, will execute the
    call to <code>main()</code> which will start the program executing.
    However, we don't want the computer to execute the program while it
    is executing the test functions, so we have a problem. How can we
    get the computer to import the program functions without executing
    the <code>main</code> function? Fortunately, the developers of
    Python gave us a solution to this problem. Instead of writing the
    following code to start our program running:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
# Start this program by
# calling the main function.
main()</pre></div>

    <p>We write an <code>if</code> statement above the call to
    <code>main()</code> like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
# If this file is executed like this:
# &gt; python program.py
# then call the main function. However, if this file is simply
# imported (e.g. into a test file), then skip the call to main.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

    <p>Writing the <code>if</code> statement above the call to
    <code>main()</code> is the correct way to write code to start a
    program. The Python programming language guarantees that when the
    computer imports the program functions (in order to test them), the
    comparison in the <code>if</code> statement will be false, so the
    computer will skip the call to <code>main()</code>. At another time,
    when the computer executes the program (not the test functions), the
    comparison in the <code>if</code> statement will be true, which will
    cause the computer to call the <code>main</code> function and start
    the program.</p>

    <h3 id="l05_prepare_test_which_funcs">Which Program Functions Should We Test?</h3>
    <p>Because we are responsible computer programmers and want to
    ensure that all of our program functions work correctly, we would
    like to test all program functions. In other words, we would like to
    write at least one test function for each program function. However,
    this may not always be possible. The easiest program functions to
    test are the functions that have parameters and return a value. The
    hardest program functions to test are the functions that get user
    input, print results to a terminal window, or draw something to a
    window. During the next eight lessons in CSE&nbsp;111, we will
    usually write one test function for each program function that is
    easy to test, meaning each function that does not get user input and
    does not print to a terminal window. This means that you won't write
    a test function for your program's <code>main</code> function
    because <code>main</code> usually gets user input and prints to a
    terminal window.</p>

    <h2 id="l05_prepare_summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>During this lesson, you are learning to write test functions that
    automatically verify that program functions are working correctly.
    In CSE&nbsp;111, you will write test functions in a Python file that
    is separate from your program file. At the top of the test file, you
    will import the program functions. Then you will write one test
    function for each program function, except <code>main</code>. Within
    a test function, you will write <code>assert</code> statements that
    compare the value returned from a program function to the expected
    value. You will use a standard Python module named
    <code>pytest</code> to run your test functions. When a test fails,
    you will use the output of <code>pytest</code> to help you find and
    fix the mistakes in your code.</p>

    <p>The following call graph shows the function calls and returns in

    that the computer starts executing the sample test functions by
    calling the <code>pytest.main</code> function. While executing the
    <code>pytest.main</code> function, the computer calls the
    <code>test_prefix</code> function. While executing the
    <code>test_prefix</code> function, the computer calls the
    <code>prefix</code> function. Then while still executing the
    <code>pytest.main</code> function, the computer calls the
    <code>test_suffix</code> function. While executing the
    <code>test_suffix</code> function, the computer calls the
    <code>suffix</code> function.</p>

    <h2 id="l05_check_ponder">Ponder</h2>
    <p>During this assignment, you downloaded a Python file that
    contains two program functions named <code>prefix</code> and
    <code>suffix</code>. You wrote a test function named
    <code>test_suffix</code> that is similar to the
    <code>test_prefix</code> function that was given to you. You used
    <code>pytest</code> to run both test functions and examined the
    output of <code>pytest</code> to verify that the test functions
    passed. Because the test functions called <code>prefix</code> and
    <code>suffix</code> with many different arguments and verified
    (using <code>assert</code>) that the values returned from
    <code>prefix</code> and <code>suffix</code> were correct, we can
    assume that the <code>prefix</code> and <code>suffix</code>
    functions work correctly. Do you think writing and running test
    functions will help you write better programs?</p>

    <h1>05 Team Activity: Testing and Fixing Functions</h1>

    <h2 id="l05_teach_instrucs">Instructions</h2>
    <p>Work as a team as explained in the instructions for the
    <a href="../lesson02/teach.html#instrucs">lesson&nbsp;2 team
    activity</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="l05_teach_purpose">Purpose</h2>
    <p>Writing and running test functions often help a software
    developer find mistakes in code. During this assignment, you will
    write three test functions. Then use <code>pytest</code> to run the
    test functions and use the output of <code>pytest</code> to help you
    find and fix errors in some program functions.</p>

    <h2 id="l05_teach_problem">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Most people around the world today have at least two names, a
    family name and a given name. In the United States, we usually write
    a person's given name followed by his family name. However, when a
    computer lists names in alphabetical order, it is convenient to list
    the family name first and then the given name like this:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>Toussaint; Marie</div></li>
        <li><div>Toussaint; Olivier</div></li>
        <li><div>Washington; George</div></li>
        <li><div>Washington; Martha</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>When writing a program that alphabetizes names, it is often
    helpful to have the following three functions.</p>
    <dl class="function">
        <dt><pre class="python">make_full_name</pre></dt>
        <dd>Combines a person's given name and family name into one
        string with the family name first</dd>
        <dt><code>extract_family_name</code></dt>
        <dd>Extracts a person's family name from his full name</dd>
        <dt><code>extract_given_name</code></dt>
        <dd>Extracts a person's given name from his full name</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>A programmer has already written those three functions. However,
    there are mistakes in at least two of the three functions.</p>

    <h2 id="l05_teach_assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>As a team, write three test functions named
    <code>test_make_full_name</code>,
    <code>test_extract_family_name</code>, and
    <code>test_extract_given_name</code>. Each of the test functions
    will test one of three previously written program functions. Use
    <code>pytest</code> to run the test functions and find and fix the
    mistakes, if any, that are in program functions.</p>

    <h2 id="l05_teach_helpful_docs">Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <ul class="mixed long">
        <li class="tutorial"><div>The <a href="prepare.html">prepare
        content</a> for this lesson explains how to use
        <code>pytest</code>, <code>assert</code>, and
        <code>approx</code> to automatically verify that functions are
        correct. It also contains an <a href="prepare.html#ex">example
        test function</a> and links to additional documentation about
        <code>pytest</code>.</div></li>

        <li class="video"><div>This
        <a href="https://video.byui.edu/media/t/1_9ickss60">video about
        test functions</a> <span class="duration">(20 minutes)</span>
        shows a BYU-Idaho faculty member writing two test functions and
        using <code>pytest</code> to run them.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="l05_teach_steps">Steps</h2>
    <p>Do the following:</p>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Download the <a download href="names.py">names.py</a>
        Python file and save it in the same folder where you will save
        your Python test program. Then open the downloaded file in VS
        Code. Notice that the downloaded file contains three small
        functions named: <code>make_full_name</code>,
        <code>extract_family_name</code>, and
        <code>extract_given_name</code>. Notice also that each function
        has a documentation string (a triple quoted string immediately
        below the function header) that describes what the function
        does. Read the documentation strings for all three functions.
        The code in the functions may contain some mistakes.</div></li>

        <li><div>Using VS Code, open a new Python file and copy and
        paste the following import statements at the top of the file.
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">from names import make_full_name, \
    extract_family_name, extract_given_name
import pytest</pre></div>
        Save the file with the name <code>test_names.py</code> in the
        same folder where you downloaded and saved the
        <code>names.py</code> file.</div></li>

        <li><div>In <code>test_names.py</code>, write a function named
        <code>test_make_full_name</code> that takes no parameters. Write
        <code>assert</code> statements inside this function to test the
        value returned from the <code>make_full_name</code> function. If
        you are not sure what the <code>make_full_name</code> function
        does or how to test it, read the documentation string that is at
        the top of the <code>make_full_name</code> function in the
        <code>names.py</code> file.</div></li>

        <li><div>In <code>test_names.py</code> write a function named
        <code>test_extract_family_name</code> that takes no parameters.
        Write <code>assert</code> statements inside this function to
        test the value returned from the
        <code>extract_family_name</code> function.</div></li>

        <li><div>In <code>test_names.py</code> write a function named
        <code>test_extract_given_name</code> that takes no parameters.
        Write <code>assert</code> statements inside this function to
        test the value returned from the <code>extract_given_name</code>
        function.</div></li>

        <li><div>At the bottom of your <code>test_names.py</code> file,
        write a call to the <code>pytest.main</code> function like this:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
# Call the main function that is part of pytest so that the
# computer will execute the test functions in this file.
pytest.main(["-v", "--tb=line", "-rN", __file__])</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Save your <code>test_names.py</code> file and run it by
        clicking the green run icon in VS Code.</div></li>

        <li><div>Read the output from <code>pytest</code> and use the
        output to help you find and fix any errors that are in your test
        functions or the <code>make_full_name</code>,
        <code>extract_family_name</code>, and
        <code>extract_given_name</code> functions.</div></li>

        <li><div>Repeat steps&nbsp;7 and&nbsp;8 until you have found and
        fixed all the mistakes and your three test functions
        pass.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="l05_teach_required">Core Requirements</h3>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Write <code>test_make_full_name</code> so that it tests
        <code>make_full_name</code> with various names, including long
        names, short names, and hyphenated names. Fix the mistake in the
        <code>make_full_name</code> function.</div></li>

        <li><div>Write <code>test_extract_family_name</code> so that it
        tests <code>extract_family_name</code> with various names,
        including long names, short names, and hyphenated
        names.</div></li>

        <li><div>Write <code>test_extract_given_name</code> so that it
        tests <code>extract_given_name</code> with various names,
        including long names, short names, and hyphenated names. Fix the
        mistake in the <code>extract_given_name</code>
        function.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="l05_teach_stretch">Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an hour,
    complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that the
    stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div><p>In the United States, mailing addresses are supposed
        to be written
        <br>in this form:
        <span class="nowrap"><var>number</var> <var>street</var>, <var>city</var>, <var>state</var> <var>zipcode</var></span>
        <br>For example:
        <span class="nowrap">525 S Center St, Rexburg, ID 83460</span></p>

        <p>Download and save this Python file named
        <a download href="address.py">address.py</a>. Open a new Python
        file named <code>test_address.py</code> and write a test
        function named <code>test_extract_city</code> that verifies that
        the <code>extract_city</code> function works correctly.</p>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Write a test function named
        <code>test_extract_state</code> that verifies that the
        extract_state function works correctly.</div></li>

        <li><div>Write a test function named
        <code>test_extract_zipcode</code> that verifies that the
        extract_zipcode function works correctly.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="l05_teach_testing">Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Before you fix the mistakes in the <code>make_full_name</code>
    and <code>extract_given_name</code> functions, <code>pytest</code>
    will print output similar to this:</p>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your solution to the
    <a class="solution" href="teach_solution.py">sample solution</a>
    and the
    <a class="solution" href="teach_stretch.py">stretch solution</a>.
    Please <strong>do not look at the sample solutions</strong> until
    you have either finished the program or diligently worked for at
    least one hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling
    to complete the assignment, you may use the sample solution to help
    you finish.</p>

    <h3>Call Graph</h3>
    <p>The following call graph shows the function calls and returns in
    the sample solution for this assignment. From this call graph we see
    that the computer starts executing the sample test functions by
    calling the <code>pytest.main</code> function. While executing the
    <code>pytest.main</code> function, the computer calls the
    <code>test_make_full_name</code> function which calls the
    <code>make_full_name</code> function. Then while still executing
    <code>pytest.main</code>, the computer calls the
    <code>test_extract_family_name</code> function which calls the
    <code>extract_family_name</code> function. Then while still
    executing <code>pytest.main</code>, the computer calls the
    <code>test_extract_given_name</code> function which calls the
    <code>extract_given_name</code> function.</p>

        title="A function call graph for this assignment">
    </figure>

    <h2>Ponder</h2>
    <p>During this assignment, you downloaded three program functions
    that work with a person's name. You wrote three test functions that
    each test one of the program functions. You used <code>pytest</code>
    to run your test functions and used the output of
    <code>pytest</code> to help you find and fix the mistakes in the
    program functions. How will writing and running test functions help
    you write better programs?</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>

    <h1>05 Prove Milestone: Testing and Fixing Functions</h1>

    <h2 id="l05_prove_purpose">Purpose</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a Python program and write and run test
    functions to help you find and fix mistakes.</p>

    <h2 id="l05_prove_problem">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>The <dfn>Turing test</dfn>, named after Alan Turing, is a test of
    a computer's ability to make conversation that is indistinguishable
    from human conversation. A computer that could pass the Turing test
    would need to understand sentences typed by a human and respond with
    sentences that make sense.</p>

    <p>In English and many other languages, <dfn>grammatical
    quantity</dfn> (also known as grammatical number) is an attribute of
    nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and verbs that expresses count
    distinctions, such as "one", "two", "some", or "many". The
    grammatical quantity of the words in a sentence must match. In
    English, there are two categories of grammatical quantity: single
    and plural. For example, here are three English sentences that
    contain <dfn>single</dfn> nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and
    verbs:</p>

    <blockquote>The boy laughs.<br>
    One dog eats.<br>
    She drinks water.</blockquote>

    <p>Here are three English sentences that contain <dfn>plural</dfn>
    nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and verbs:</p>

    <blockquote>Two birds fly.<br>
    Some animals eat grass.<br>
    Many cars are red.</blockquote>

    <p><dfn>Grammatical tense</dfn> is an attribute of verbs that
    expresses when an action happened. Many languages include past,
    present, and future tenses. For example, here are three English
    sentences, the first with past tense, the second with present tense,
    and the third with future tense:</p>

    <blockquote>The cat walked.<br>
    The cat walks.<br>
    The cat will walk.</blockquote>

    <h2 id="l05_prove_assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>Write a Python program named <code>sentences.py</code> that
    generates simple English sentences. During this prove milestone, you
    will write and test functions that generate sentences with three
    parts:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>a determiner (sometimes known as an article)</div></li>
        <li><div>a noun</div></li>
        <li><div>a verb</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>For example:</p>
    <blockquote>A cat laughed.<br>
    One man eats.<br>
    The woman will think.<br>
    Some girls thought.<br>
    Many dogs run.<br>
    Many men will write.</blockquote>

    <p>For this milestone, your program must include at least these four
    functions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div><code>main</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>get_determiner</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>get_noun</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>get_verb</code></div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You may add other program functions if you want. The functions
    <code>get_determiner</code>, <code>get_noun</code>, and
    <code>get_verb</code>, must randomly choose a word from a list of
    words and return the randomly chosen word.</p>

    <p>In addition, for this milestone assignment, you must write a file
    named <code>test_senetences.py</code> that contains three functions
    named as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div><code>test_get_determiner</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>test_get_noun</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>test_get_verb</code></div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>All the functions that you must write for this milestone
    assignment are described in the Steps section below.</p>

        <li><div><p>Write the <code>main</code> function and any other

        </div></li>

        <li><div>At the bottom of your <code>sentences.py</code> file,
        write a call to your <code>main</code> function. Be certain to
        write the call to the <code>main</code> function inside the body
        of an <code>if</code> statement as explained in this lesson's
        prepare content in the section titled
        <a href="prepare.html#separate">Separating Program Code from
        Test Code</a>.</div></li>

        <li><div><p>In a new file named <code>test_sentences.py</code>,
        write three test functions named
        <code>test_get_determiner</code>, <code>test_get_noun</code>,
        and <code>test_get_verb</code>. Each of these three test
        functions must test one of the program functions:
        <code>get_determiner</code>, <code>get_noun</code>, and
        <code>get_verb</code>.</p>

        <p>Recall that each of the three program functions
        (<code>get_determiner</code>, <code>get_noun</code>, and
        <code>get_verb</code>) returns a word that the computer chooses
        randomly from a list of words. The random nature of the program
        functions makes the corresponding test functions a little
        difficult to implement. How do we write code to verify that a
        word chosen randomly is correct? One possible way is to verify
        that the chosen word is from the correct list. For example, if
        we write a call to the <code>get_determiner</code> function and
        pass 1 as the quantity like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">    determ = get_determiner(1)</pre></div>

        <p>Then the word in the <var>determ</var> variable should be in
        this list:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">    ["a", "one", "the"]</pre></div>

        <p>We can use the <code>assert</code> keyword and the Python
        membership operator, which is the keyword <code>in</code>, to
        verify that the word in the <var>determ</var> variable is in the
        list, like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">def test_get_determiner():
    # Call the get_determiner function.
    determ = get_determiner(1)

    # Verify that the word stored in the variable
    # determ is in the list of single determiners.
    words = ["a", "one", "the"]
    <em>assert determ in words</em></pre></div>

        <p>The following example contains code for
        the <code>test_get_determiner</code> function. Copy and paste
        the code into your <code>test_sentences.py</code> file and use
        it as an example to help you write <code>test_get_noun</code>
        and <code>test_get_verb</code>.

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
from sentences import get_determiner, get_noun, get_verb

def test_get_determiner():
    # 1. Test the single determiners.

    single_determiners = ["a", "one", "the"]

    # This loop will repeat the statements inside it 4 times.
    for _ in range(4):

        <li><div>At the bottom of your <code>test_sentences.py</code>

        the <code>sentences.py</code> program. In other words, running
        the test functions did not cause the program to print the pseudo
        random sentences. If running your test functions causes your
        program to print the pseudo random sentences, then at the bottom
        of your <code>sentences.py</code> file you must rewrite the call
        to your <code>main</code> function so that it is inside the body
        of an <code>if</code> statement. In the prepare content for this
        lesson, the section titled

        Your program's output should be similar to the sample run output

    <h2 id="l05_prove_ponder">Ponder</h2>
    <p>During this assignment, you wrote four program functions named
    <code>main</code>, <code>get_determiner</code>,
    <code>get_noun</code>, and <code>get_verb</code>. Also, in a
    separate file, you wrote three test functions named
    <code>test_get_determiner</code>, <code>test_get_noun</code>, and
    <code>test_get_verb</code>. Each of the test functions called one of
    the program functions and automatically verified that the value
    returned from the program function was correct. If you worked as a
    software developer on a large project with four other software
    developers, how would test functions help you and the other
    developers write better code?</p>

<section>
    <h1>06 Prepare: Troubleshooting Functions</h1>
    <p>What should you do when your program isn't working? If your
    program is small, you could examine each line of the program.
    However, if your program is large or contains multiple functions,
    there are better ways to find and fix the problems, including
    writing and running test functions, writing print statements, and
    using a debugger.</p>

    <h2 id="l06_prepare_concepts">Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn during this lesson.</p>

    <h3 id="l06_prepare_err_types">Types of Mistakes</h3>
    <p>Broadly speaking, there are two types of mistakes or errors that
    a programmer might make when writing a program: syntax errors and
    logic errors. A <dfn>syntax error</dfn> is a mistake made by a
    programmer that violates the rules of a programming language such as
    misspelling a keyword, forgetting to type a closing parenthesis, or
    forgetting to type a colon (:) at the end of an <code>if</code>
    statement. A syntax error will cause the computer to terminate a
    Python program and print an error message to the terminal window. A
    <dfn>logic error</dfn> is a mistake made by a programmer that causes
    the computer to produce the wrong results. Often, a logic error will
    not cause the computer to terminate a program or to print an error
    message. It will simply cause the computer to produce incorrect
    results.</p>

    <h3 id="l06_prepare_err_msgs">Error Messages</h3>
    <p>Regardless of the type of error (syntax or logic), if the
    computer prints an error message while executing a program, the
    first thing a programmer should do is read and understand the error
    message. Example&nbsp;1 shows a simple Python program that contains
    a syntax error. The message that the computer printed because of the
    syntax error is shown below example&nbsp;1.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l06_prepare_ex1"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 1

def main():
    print("Are you surprised, Clark?)

# Start this program by
# calling the main function.

    <p>From the error message, we read that example&nbsp;1 contains a
    syntax error and that the error is on line&nbsp;4 of the program
    where there is something wrong with the string. By examining the
    error message and the program at line&nbsp;4, we learn that the
    programmer forgot to type the closing double quote at the end of the
    string. By the way, <dfn>EOL</dfn> that appears in the error message
    is an acronym for "end of line." You might also see the acronyms
    <dfn>EOF</dfn> and <dfn>EOT</dfn> which mean "end of file" and "end
    of transmission."</p>

    <p>If the computer prints an error message that you don't
    understand, you can search the internet for its meaning. Simply copy
    and paste the error message into the search bar of your browser.
    Here are two of the search results from Google for the error message
    "SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal."</p>

<a href="https://discover.cs.ucsb.edu/commonerrors/error/1010.xml">SyntaxError- EOL while scanning string literal</a>
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal "EOL" stands for "end of line". An EOL error means that Python hit the end of a line while going through a string.

<a href="https://www.askpython.com/python/syntax-error-eol-while-scanning-string-literal">Syntax Error: EOL while scanning string literal - AskPython</a>
EOL stands for "End of Line". The error means that the Python Interpreter reached the end of the line when it tried to scan the string literal. The string literals (constants) must be enclosed in single and double quotation marks.</div>

    <h3 id="l06_prepare_print">Print Statements</h3>
    <p>If the computer doesn't print an error message, but your program
    is producing incorrect results, you could add print statements to
    your program in strategic locations to help you find the mistakes.
    These print statements should print the value of the variables in
    your program so that you can examine the values to ensure they are
    correct. Example&nbsp;2 contains a program with a complex
    calculation for computing the remaining balance of a loan. Notice
    the print statements at
    lines&nbsp;<span class="cross" data-ref="l06_prepare_ex2">28, 32, and&nbsp;35</span>
    and also at
    lines&nbsp;<span class="cross" data-ref="l06_prepare_ex2">43, 47, and&nbsp;50</span>.
    The programmer wrote these print statements at important points in
    the program, specifically near the beginning of each function and in
    the middle of the calculations.</p>

    <p>Although print statements are simple to understand and add to a
    program and often helpful, in many situations they are not the most
    effective way to find logic errors.</p>

    <h3 id="l06_prepare_test_funcs">Test Functions</h3>
    <p>Many programmers underestimate the effectiveness of writing and
    running test functions to find logic errors in a program. Many
    programmers will write a complete program with multiple functions
    and never pause to test any part of it. Instead, they will write the
    entire program and then do something similar to the following steps
    to test it.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Run the program and enter input like a user
        would.</div></li>
        <li><div>Examine the program's output and discover that the
        output is incorrect.</div></li>
        <li><div>Review all the program's code, make some small changes,
        and add print statements.</div></li>
        <li><div>Repeat steps 1&ndash;3 again and again and again,
        spending lots of time trying to find and fix the
        errors.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>This method for finding and fixing mistakes is time consuming
    because the programmer is trying to test the whole program at once.
    Instead, the programmer should test each individual function by
    writing and running test functions as explained in the
    <a href="../lesson05/prepare.html">previous lesson</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="l06_prepare_debugger">Using a Debugger</h3>
    <p>A <dfn>debugger</dfn> is a software development tool that allows
    a programmer to watch the computer execute the statements in a
    program. While using a debugger, a programmer can examine the values
    stored in a program's variables as the computer executes each line
    of the program. A debugger is a very effective tool for finding
    mistakes in a program. Nearly all programming languages and
    environments include a debugger. Professional software developers
    use a debugger nearly every single work day. Most companies will not
    use a programming language unless that language includes a
    debugger.</p>

    <p>The Python programming language includes a debugger that you can
    use while writing a program in VS Code. It is much easier to learn
    how to use a debugger by watching someone use it than by reading
    about a debugger. Watch the following video that shows a BYU-Idaho
    faculty member using a debugger in VS Code to find mistakes in a
    program.</p>

    <ul class="videos">
        <li><div>How to Use the <a href="https://video.byui.edu/media/t/1_k7ubjwmu">Python Debugger in VS Code</a> <span class="duration">(17 minutes)</span>
        <div><iframe class="video" id="l06_prepare_kaltura_player"
        title="Debugging a Python Program"
        style="min-width:44em;min-height:25em" allowfullscreen
        src="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/1157612/sp/115761200/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/41338032/partner_id/1157612?iframeembed=true&playerId=kaltura_player&entry_id=1_k7ubjwmu"></iframe></div>
        </div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>A debugger is also a great learning tool. Using a debugger to
    step through the statements of your program one at a time and
    examining the values of the variables after each step will show you
    exactly how Python works. Try it! If you don't completely understand
    <code>if</code>-<code>elif</code>-<code>else</code> statements,
    <code>while</code> loops, <code>for</code> loops, passing
    parameters, or returning a value from a function, then put one or
    more breakpoints in a program that contains those elements, start
    the program in the debugger, and step through it one line at a time.
    After the computer executes each statement, examine the values of
    the variables and predict in your mind how the next statement will
    change the values of the variables.</p>

    <h2 id="l06_prepare_summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>During this lesson, you are learning the difference between a
    syntax error and a logic error. A syntax error is a mistake made by
    a programmer that violates the rules of a programming language and
    prevents a program from running. Usually, you must fix all syntax
    errors before your program will run. After you fix all syntax
    errors, your program will run but may contain logic errors. A logic
    error is a mistake made by a programmer that causes the computer to
    produce the wrong results. Some tools that you can use to find and
    fix the logic errors in your programs are test functions, print
    statements, and a debugger.</p>

    code.</p>

    <h2 id="l06_teach_problem">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>The Rosenberg self-esteem scale is a self-esteem measure
    developed by the sociologist Morris Rosenberg in 1965. It is still
    used in social-science research today. To complete the measure, a
    person completes a survey that contains the following ten
    statements.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>I feel that I am a person of worth, at least on an
        equal plane with others.</div></li>
        <li><div>I feel that I have a number of good qualities.</div></li>
        <li><div>All in all, I am inclined to feel that I am a
        failure.</div></li>
        <li><div>I am able to do things as well as most other
        people.</div></li>
        <li><div>I feel I do not have much to be proud of.</div></li>
        <li><div>I take a positive attitude toward myself.</div></li>
        <li><div>On the whole, I am satisfied with myself.</div></li>
        <li><div>I wish I could have more respect for myself.</div></li>
        <li><div>I certainly feel useless at times.</div></li>
        <li><div>At times I think I am no good at all.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>The person responds to each statement by choosing one of these
    four options: strongly disagree, disagree, agree, or strongly agree.
    The person's response to each statement is worth 0&ndash;3 points,
    meaning the highest possible score is
    <span class="inline formula">10 * 3 = 30</span> points. If a person
    scores lower than 15 points, the person may have a problematic low
    self-esteem.</p>

    <p>Notice that five of the statements (numbers 1, 2, 4, 6, 7) are
    positive and are scored like this:</p>
    <table class="center"><thead>
        <tr><th>Choice</th> <th>Points</th></tr>
    </thead><tbody>
        <tr><td>Strongly Disagree</td> <td class="number">0</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Disagree</td> <td class="number">1</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Agree</td> <td class="number">2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Strongly Agree</td> <td class="number">3</td></tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p>The other five statements (numbers 3, 5, 8, 9, 10) are
    negative and are scored like this:</p>
    <table class="center"><thead>
        <tr><th>Choice</th> <th>Points</th></tr>
    </thead><tbody>
        <tr><td>Strongly Disagree</td> <td class="number">3</td></tr>

        <tr><td>Agree</td> <td class="number">1</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Strongly Agree</td> <td class="number">0</td></tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <h2 id="l06_teach_assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>As a team, write a Python program named <code>esteem.py</code>
    that implements the Rosenberg self-esteem scale. Your program must
    ask the user to respond to each of the ten statements with D, d, a,
    or A which mean strongly disagree, disagree, agree, and strongly
    agree. Your program must compute the score for each answer and sum
    and display the person's total score. You should think about how you
    will separate this program into functions before you begin writing
    the program.</p>

    spatial or temporal relations, such as "in", "over", and "before". A
    <dfn>prepositional phrase</dfn> is group of words that begins with a
    preposition and includes a noun. For example:</p>

    <blockquote>above the water<br>
    in the kitchen<br>
    after the meeting</blockquote>

    <h2 id="l06_prove_assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>Write the second half of the Python program that you began in the
    previous lesson's <a href="../lesson05/prove.html">prove milestone</a>,
    a program that generates simple English sentences. During this prove
    assignment, you will write and test functions that generate
    sentences with four parts:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>a determiner</div></li>
        <li><div>a noun</div></li>
        <li><div>a verb</div></li>
        <li><div>a prepositional phrase </div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>For example:</p>
    <blockquote>One girl talked for the car.<br>
    A bird drinks off one child.<br>
    The child will run on the car.<br>
    Some dogs drank above many rabbits.<br>
    Some children laugh at many dogs.<br>
    Some rabbits will talk about some cats.</blockquote>

    <p>To complete this prove assignment, your program must include at
    least these six functions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div><code>main</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>get_determiner</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>get_noun</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>get_verb</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>get_preposition</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>get_prepositional_phrase</code></div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You may add other functions if you find them helpful. The
    <code>get_preposition</code> function must randomly choose a
    preposition from a list and return the randomly chosen preposition.
    The <code>get_prepositional_phrase</code> function must make a
    prepositional phrase by calling the <code>get_preposition</code>,
    <code>get_determiner</code>, and <code>get_noun</code> functions.</p>

    <p>In addition, to complete this prove assignment, you must write
    and submit a file named <code>test_senetences.py</code> that
    contains five functions named as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div><code>test_get_determiner</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>test_get_noun</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>test_get_verb</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>test_get_preposition</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>test_get_prepositional_phrase</code></div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="l06_prove_steps">Steps</h2>
    <p>Do the following:</p>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Use the <code>get_determiner</code> function from the
        previous lesson's prove milestone as an example to help you
        write the <code>get_preposition</code> function. The
        <code>get_preposition</code> function must have the following
        header and fulfill the requirements of the following
        documentation string.

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
def get_preposition():
    """Return a randomly chosen preposition
    from this list of prepositions:
        "about", "above", "across", "after", "along",

        "beyond", "by", "despite", "except", "for",
        "from", "in", "into", "near", "of",
        "off", "on", "onto", "out", "over",
        "past", "to", "under", "with", "without"

    Return: a randomly chosen preposition.
    """</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Write the <code>get_prepositional_phrase</code>
        function to have the following header and fulfill the
        requirements of the following documentation string.

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
def get_prepositional_phrase(quantity):
    """Build and return a prepositional phrase composed of three
    words: a preposition, a determiner, and a noun by calling the

            and noun in the prepositional phrase returned from
            this function are single or pluaral.
    Return: a prepositional phrase.
    """</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div><p>Add code to the <code>main</code> function and write
        any other functions that you think are necessary for your
        program to generate and print six sentences, each with a
        determiner, a noun, a verb, and a prepositional phrase. The six
        sentences must have the following characteristics:</p>

        <table class="center"><thead>
            <tr><th></th> <th>Quantity</th> <th>Verb Tense</th></tr>
        </thead><tbody>
            <tr><td>a.</td> <td>single</td> <td>past</td></tr>
            <tr><td>b.</td> <td>single</td> <td>present</td></tr>
            <tr><td>c.</td> <td>single</td> <td>future</td></tr>
            <tr><td>d.</td> <td>plural</td> <td>past</td></tr>
            <tr><td>e.</td> <td>plural</td> <td>present</td></tr>
            <tr><td>f.</td> <td>plural</td> <td>future</td></tr>
        </tbody></table>
        </div></li>

        <li><div><p>In the <code>test_sentences.py</code> file that you
        wrote during the previous lesson's prove milestone, write two
        functions named <code>test_get_preposition</code> and
        <code>test_get_prepositional_phrase</code> that test the
        <code>get_preposition</code> and
        <code>get_prepositional_phrase</code> functions.</p>

        <p>Perhaps you are wondering what code you should write in the
        <code>test_get_prepositional_phrase</code> function. To answer
        that question, ask yourself, "What do we know about the
        <code>get_prepositional_phrase</code> function?" From its
        description, we know the <code>get_prepositional_phrase</code>
        function returns a string made of three words: a preposition, a
        determiner, and a noun. So you could write code in the
        <code>test_get_prepositional_phrase</code> function that calls
        the <code>get_prepositional_phrase</code> function and then
        calls the Python string
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split"><code>split</code> method</a>
        to separate the returned phrase into a list of words and
        verifies that the length of the list is three. In addition for
        each word in the list, you could write an <code>assert</code>
        statement that verifies that each word is the correct English
        part of speech.</p>

    <h2 id="l06_prove_testing">Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your test program works correctly by following each
    step in this procedure:</p>

    <ol class="test">
        <li><div>Run your <code>test_sentences.py</code> program and
        verify that all five of the test functions pass. If one or more
        of the tests don't pass, find and fix the mistakes in your

    <h1>07 Prepare: Lists and Repetition</h1>
    <p>During this lesson, you will learn how to store many elements in
    a Python list. You will learn how to write a loop that processes
    each element in a list. Also, you will learn that lists are passed
    into a function differently than numbers are passed.</p>

    <h2 id="l07_prepare_concepts">Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn during this lesson:</p>

    <h3 id="l07_prepare_lists">Lists</h3>
    <p>A Python program can store many values in a <dfn>list</dfn>.
    Lists are mutable, meaning they can be changed after they are
    created. Each value in a list is called an <dfn>element</dfn> and is
    stored at a unique index. An <dfn>index</dfn> is always an integer
    and determines where an element is stored in a list. The first index
    of a Python list is always zero (0). The following diagram shows a
    list that contains five strings. The diagram shows both the elements
    and the indexes of the list. Notice that each index is a unique
    integer, and that the first index is zero.</p>

    <figure class="center list">
        <table><tbody>
            <tr class="elems"><td class="label">elements</td>
                <td>"yellow"</td> <td>"red"</td> <td>"green"</td>
                <td>"yellow"</td> <td>"blue"</td></tr>
            <tr><td class="label">indexes</td> <td>[0]</td> <td>[1]</td>
                <td>[2]</td> <td>[3]</td> <td>[4]</td></tr>
            <tr><td></td>
                <td colspan="5">&larr; list length is 5 &rarr;</td></tr>
        </tbody></table>
    </figure>

    <p>In a Python program, we can create a list by using square
    brackets ([&nbsp;and&nbsp;]). We can determine the number of items
    in a list by calling the built-in <code>len</code> function. We can
    retrieve an item from a list and replace an item in a list using
    square brackets ([&nbsp;and&nbsp;]) and an index. Example&nbsp;1
    contains a program that creates a list, prints the length of the
    list, retrieves and prints one item from the list, changes one item
    in the list, and then prints the entire list.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l07_prepare_ex1"><pre class="python"># Example 1

def main():
    # Create a list that contains five strings.
    colors = ["yellow", "red", "green", "yellow", "blue"]

    # Call the built-in len function
    # and print the length of the list.
    length = len(colors)
    print(f"Number of elements: {length}")

    # Print the element that is stored
    # at index 2 in the colors list.
    print(colors[2])

    # Change the element that is stored at
    # index 3 from "yellow" to "purple".
    colors[3] = "purple"

    # Print the entire colors list.
    print(colors)


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="l07_prepare_ex1">&gt; python example_1.py
Number of elements: 5
green
['yellow', 'red', 'green', 'purple', 'blue']</pre>

    <p>We can add an item to a list by using the <code>insert</code> and
    <code>append</code> methods. We can determine if an element is in a
    list by using the Python membership operator, which is the keyword
    <code>in</code>. We can find the index of an item within a list by
    using the <code>index</code> method. We can remove an item from a
    list by using the <code>pop</code> and <code>remove</code> methods.
    Example&nbsp;2 shows how to create a list and add, find, and remove
    items from a list.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l07_prepare_ex2"><pre class="python"># Example 2

def main():
    # Create an empty list that will hold fabric names.
    fabrics = []

    # Add three elements at the end of the fabrics list.
    fabrics.append("velvet")
    fabrics.append("denim")
    fabrics.append("gingham")

    # Insert an element at the beginning of the fabrics list.
    fabrics.insert(0, "chiffon")
    print(fabrics)

    # Determine if gingham is in the fabrics list.
    if "gingham" in fabrics:
        print("gingham is in the list.")
    else:
        print("gingham is NOT in the list.")

    # Get the index where velvet is stored in the fabrics list.
    i = fabrics.index("velvet")

    # Replace velvet with taffeta.
    fabrics[i] = "taffeta"

    # Remove the last element from the fabrics list.
    fabrics.pop()

    # Remove denim from the fabrics list.
    fabrics.remove("denim")

    # Get the length of the fabrics list and print it.
    n = len(fabrics)
    print(f"The fabrics list contains {n} elements.")
    print(fabrics)


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="l07_prepare_ex2">&gt; python example_2.py
['chiffon', 'velvet', 'denim', 'gingham']
gingham is in the list.
The fabrics list contains 2 elements.
['chiffon', 'taffeta']</pre>

    <p>The lists in examples&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;2 store strings. Of course,
    it is possible to store numbers in a list, too. In fact, Python
    allows a program to store any data type in a list, including other
    lists.</p>

    <h3 id="l07_prepare_repetition">Repetition</h3>
    <p>A programmer can cause a computer to repeat a group of statements
    by writing <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops.</p>

    <h4 id="l07_prepare_for">for loop</h4>
    <p>A <code>for</code> loop iterates over a sequence, such as a list.
    This means a <code>for</code> loop causes the computer to repeatedly
    execute the statements in the body of the <code>for</code> loop,
    once for each element in the sequence. In example&nbsp;3, consider
    the list of colors at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex3">line&nbsp;5</span>
    and the <code>for</code> loop at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex3">lines&nbsp;8&ndash;9</span>.
    Notice how the <code>for</code> loop causes the computer to repeat
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex3">line&nbsp;9</span> once for each
    element in the <var>colors</var> list. Of course, the code in the
    body of a loop can do much more with each element than simply print
    it.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l07_prepare_ex3"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 3

def main():
    # Create a list of color names.
    colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue"]

    # Use a for loop to print each element in the list.
    <em>for color in colors:
        print(color)</em>


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="l07_prepare_ex3">&gt; python example_3.py
red
orange
yellow
green
blue</pre>

    <p>Notice in example&nbsp;3 at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex3">lines&nbsp;8&ndash;9</span> that
    just like <code>if</code> statements in Python, the body of a loop
    starts and ends with indentation.</p>

    <h4 id="l07_prepare_range">range function</h4>
    <p>The Python built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range"><code>range</code> function</a>
    creates and returns a sequence of numbers. The <code>range</code>
    function accepts one, two, or three parameters as shown in
    example&nbsp;4 and its output. Many programmers use the
    <code>range</code> function in a <code>for</code> loop to cause the
    computer to repeat code once for each number in a range of numbers.
    Example&nbsp;4 shows four <code>for</code> loops that iterate over a
    range of numbers.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l07_prepare_ex4"><pre class="python"># Example 4

def main():
    # Count from zero to nine by one.
    for i in range(10):
        print(i)
    print()

    # Count from five to nine by one.
    for i in range(5, 10):
        print(i)
    print()

    # Count from zero to eight by two.
    for i in range(0, 10, 2):
        print(i)
    print()

    # Count from 100 down to 70 by three.
    for i in range(100, 69, -3):
        print(i)


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":

    <span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex5">lines&nbsp;8&ndash;9</span> and
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex5">lines&nbsp;15&ndash;17</span>,
    there are two <code>for</code> loops. Both loops print each element
    from a list named <var>colors</var>. The first loop iterates over
    the elements in the <var>colors</var> list. The second loop uses the
    built-in <code>len</code> and <code>range</code> functions to
    iterate over the indexes of the <var>colors</var> list. Which style
    of <code>for</code> loop do you prefer to read and write? Most
    programmers prefer to write a loop like the one at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex5">lines&nbsp;8&ndash;9</span>
    because it is simpler than the one at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex5">lines&nbsp;15&ndash;17</span>.</p>

    # Use a for loop to print each element in the list.

    <p>In the previous example, the code in the body of both
    <code>for</code> loops is very short and simply prints one element
    from the list each time through the loop. However, you can write as
    many lines of code as you need in the body of a loop to repeatedly
    perform all sorts of computations for each element in a list.</p>

    <h4 id="l07_prepare_break">break statement</h4>
    <p>A <code>break</code> statement causes a loop to end early. In
    example&nbsp;6 at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex6">lines&nbsp;8&ndash;12</span>,
    there is a <code>for</code> loop that asks the user to input ten
    numbers one at a time. However, the loop will terminate early if the
    user enters a zero (0) because of the <code>if</code> statement and
    <code>break</code> statement at
    lines&nbsp;<span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex6">10 and&nbsp;11</span>.</p>

        if number == 0:

    <h4 id="l07_prepare_while">while loop</h4>
    <p>A <code>while</code> loop is more flexible than a
    <code>for</code> loop and repeats while some condition is true.
    Imagine that we need a function to compare the contents of two
    lists? Can we use a loop to compare the contents of two lists?
    Example&nbsp;7 contains a <code>while</code> loop at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex7">lines&nbsp;35&ndash;46</span>
    with an <code>if</code> statement at

    <h3 id="l07_prepare_vals_and_refs">Values and References</h3>
    <p>In a Python program, the computer assigns values to variables
    differently based on their data type. Consider the small program in
    example&nbsp;10 and the output of that program. The program in
    example&nbsp;10 contains two integer variables named <var>x</var>
    and <var>y</var>. The program in example&nbsp;10 does the
    following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><div>The statement at
        <span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex10">line&nbsp;4</span>
        stores the value 17 into the variable <var>x</var>.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex10">Line&nbsp;5</span>
        copies the value that is in the variable <var>x</var> into the
        variable <var>y</var>.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex10">Line&nbsp;6</span>
        prints the values of <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> which are
        both 17.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex10">Line&nbsp;7</span>
        adds one to the value of <var>x</var>, making its value 18
        instead of 17.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex10">Line&nbsp;8</span>
        prints the values of <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> again. The
        value of <var>x</var> was changed to 18. The value of
        <var>y</var> remained unchanged.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Why does <span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex10">line&nbsp;7</span>
    (<code>x += 1</code>) change the value of <var>x</var> but not
    change the value of <var>y</var>&thinsp;? Because
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex10">line&nbsp;5</span> copies
    <em>the value</em> that was in <var>x</var> into <var>y</var>. In
    other words, <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> are two separate
    variables, each with its own value.</p>

    <p>Example&nbsp;11 shows a small Python program that contains two
    variables named <var>lx</var> and <var>ly</var> that each refer to a
    list. This program is similar to the previous program, but it has
    two lists instead of two integers. From the output of
    example&nbsp;11, we see there is a big difference between the way a
    Python program assigns integers and the way it assigns lists. The
    program in example&nbsp;11 does the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><div>The statement at
        <span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex11">line&nbsp;4</span>
        creates a list and stores a reference to that list in the
        variable <var>lx</var>.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex11">Line&nbsp;5</span>
        copies the reference in the variable <var>lx</var> into the
        variable <var>ly</var>. Line&nbsp;5 does not create a copy of
        the list but instead causes both the variables <var>lx</var> and
        <var>ly</var> to refer to the same list.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex11">Line&nbsp;6</span>
        prints the values of <var>lx</var> and <var>ly</var>. Notice
        that their values are the same as we expect them to be because
        of line&nbsp;5.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex11">Line&nbsp;7</span>
        appends the number 5 onto the list <var>lx</var>.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex11">Line&nbsp;8</span>
        prints the values of <var>lx</var> and <var>ly</var> again.
        Notice in the output that when <var>lx</var> and <var>ly</var>
        are printed the second time, it appears that the number 5 was
        appended to both lists.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Why does it appear that appending the number 5 onto <var>lx</var>
    also appends the number 5 onto <var>ly</var>&thinsp;? Because
    <var>lx</var> and <var>ly</var> refer to the same list. There is
    really only one list with two references to that list. Because
    <var>lx</var> and <var>ly</var> refer to the same list, a change to
    the list through variable <var>lx</var> can be seen through variable
    <var>ly</var>.</p>

    <p>From examples&nbsp;10 and&nbsp;11, we learn that when a computer
    executes a Python statement to assign the value of a boolean,
    integer, or float variable to another variable (<code>y = x</code>),
    the computer copies <em>the value</em> of one variable into the
    other. However, when a computer executes a Python statement to
    assign the value of a list variable to another variable
    (<code>ly = lx</code>), the computer does not copy <em>the
    value</em> but instead copies <em>the reference</em> so that both
    variables refer to the same list in memory.</p>

    <h3 id="l07_prepare_pass_by_ref">Pass by Value and Pass by Reference</h3>
    <p>The fact that the computer copies the value of some data types
    (boolean, integer, float) and copies the reference for other data
    types (list and other large data types) has important implications
    for passing arguments into functions. Consider the Python program in
    example&nbsp;12 with two functions named <code>main</code> and
    <code>modify_args</code>. The program in example&nbsp;12 does the
    following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><div>The statement at
        <span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex12">line&nbsp;5</span> assigns
        the value 5 to a variable named <var>x</var>.</div></li>

        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex12">Line&nbsp;6</span>
        assigns a list to a variable named <var>lx</var>.</div></li>

        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex12">Line&nbsp;7 </span>
        prints the values of <var>x</var> and <var>lx</var> before they
        are passed to the <var>modify_args</var> function.</div></li>

        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex12">Line&nbsp;11</span>
        calls the <code>modify_args</code> function and passes
        <var>x</var> and <var>lx</var> to that function.</div></li>

        <li><div>Within the <code>modify_args</code> function,
        <span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex12">line&nbsp;28</span>
        changes the value of the parameter <var>n</var> by adding one to
        it, and <span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex12">line&nbsp;29</span>
        changes the value of the parameter <var>alist</var> by appending
        the number 4 onto it.</div></li>

        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="l07_prepare_ex12">Line&nbsp;13</span>
        prints the values of <var>x</var> and <var>lx</var> after they
        were passed to the <code>modify_args</code> function. Notice in
        the output below that the value of <var>x</var> was not changed
        by the <code>modify_args</code> function. However, the value of
        <var>lx</var> was changed by the <code>modify_args</code>

After calling modify_args():  x 5  <em>lx [7, -2, 4]</em></pre>

    <p>From the output of example&nbsp;12, we see that modifying an
    integer parameter changes the integer within the called function
    only. However, modifying a list parameter changes the list within
    the called function and within the calling function. Why? Because
    when a computer passes a boolean, integer, or float variable to a
    function, the computer copies <em>the value</em> of that variable
    into the parameter of the called function. Copying the value of an
    argument into a parameter is known as <dfn>pass by value</dfn>.
    However, when a computer passes a list variable to a function, the
    computer copies <em>the reference</em> so that the original variable
    and the parameter both refer to the same list in memory. Copying the
    reference of an argument into a parameter is known as <dfn>pass by
    reference</dfn>.</p>

    <h3 id="l07_prepare_rationale">Rationale for Pass by Reference</h3>
    <p>Why are booleans and numbers passed to a function by value and
    lists are passed to a function by reference? To understand the
    answer to this question, consider the work a computer would have to
    do if lists were passed by value.</p>

    <p>When a computer passes a number (or boolean) variable to a
    function, the number is passed by value which means the computer
    copies the value of the number variable into the parameter of the
    called function. This works well for numbers because each number
    variable occupies a small amount of the computer's memory. Making a
    copy of a number is fast, and the copy uses a small amount of
    memory.</p>

    <p>However, a list may contain millions of elements and therefore
    occupy a large amount of the computer's memory. If lists were passed
    by value to a function, the computer would have to make a copy of a
    list each time it is passed to a function. If a list is large,
    copying the list takes a relatively long time and uses a lot of the
    computer's memory for the copy. Therefore, to make programs fast and
    use less memory, lists (and other large data types) are passed to a
    function by reference.</p>

    <h2 id="l07_prepare_summmary">Summary</h2>
    <p>During this lesson, you are learning how to store many values in
    a list. Each element in a list is stored at a unique index. Each
    index is an integer, and the first index in a Python list is always
    zero (0). The built-in <code>len</code> function will return the
    number of elements stored in a list. The index of the last element
    in a Python list is always one less than the length of the list.
    To retrieve or store one element in a list, you can use the square
    brackets ([&nbsp;and&nbsp;]) and an index. To process all the
    elements in a list, you can write a <code>for</code> loop. A
    compound list is a list that stores smaller lists.</p>

    <p>During this lesson, you are also learning the difference between
    passing arguments into a function by value and by reference. Numbers
    are passed into a function by value, meaning that the computer
    copies the number from an argument into a parameter. Lists are
    passed into a function by reference, meaning the computer does not
    make a copy of a list argument but instead passes a reference to the
    list into a called function. Because lists are passed by reference,
    if a called function changes a list that is a parameter, that
    function is not changing a copy of the list but instead is changing
    the original list from the calling function.</p>

    <h1>07 Checkpoint: Lists</h1>

    <h2 id="l07_check_purpose">Purpose</h2>
    <p>Reinforce your understanding that numbers are passed to a
    function by value and lists are passed to a function by
    reference.</p>

    <h2 id="l07_check_problem">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Within a Python program, when a number is passed as an argument
    to a function, the computer copies the number from the argument into
    the parameter. In other words, the parameter gets a copy of the
    value that is in the argument. However, when a list is passed as an
    argument to a function, the computer does not copy the list.
    Instead, the computer copies a reference to the list into the
    parameter. This means the argument and parameter refer to the same
    list. If a called function changes a list that was passed to the
    function, this will change the list in both the calling and called
    functions because both the argument and parameter refer to the same
    list.</p>

    <h2 id="l07_check_assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>During this checkpoint, you will examine and run a Python program
    that passes both a number and a list to function. Do the following:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Download and save the
        <a download href="pass_args.py">pass_args.py</a> Python file and
        then open it in VS Code.</div></li>

        <li><div>Run the <code>pass_args.py</code> program on your
        computer. Examine the code and the output and answer the
        following three questions:
        <ol>
            <li><div>In <code>main</code>, there are two local variables
            named <var>x</var> and <var>lx</var>. At line&nbsp;14, both
            of these local variables are passed to the
            <code>modify_args</code> function. After the call to
            <code>modify_args</code> finished, which of
            <code>main</code>'s two local variables did the
            <code>modify_args</code> function change?
            <ol>
                <li><div><var>x</var></div></li>

            <li><div>Why is the <code>modify_args</code> function NOT
            able to change <code>main</code>'s local variable <var>x</var>?
            <ol>
                <li><div>Because <var>x</var> is a number and therefore
                passed to a function by value</div></li>
                <li><div>Because <var>x</var> is a list and therefore
                passed to a function by reference</div></li>
            </ol></div></li>

            <li><div>Why is the <code>modify_args</code> function able
            to change <code>main</code>'s local variable <var>lx</var>?
            <ol>
                <li><div>Because <var>lx</var> is a number and therefore
                passed to a function by value</div></li>
                <li><div>Because <var>lx</var> is a list and therefore

    <a href="../lesson02/teach.html#instrucs">lesson&nbsp;2 team
    activity</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="l07_teach_purpose">Purpose</h2>
    <p>There are a few details about writing and calling functions in
    Python that, if you understand, will help you be a more effective
    programmer. These details include default parameter values and pass
    by reference. As a team during this activity, you will write and
    call a function that demonstrates both default parameter values and
    pass by reference.</p>

    <h2 id="l07_teach_helpful_docs">Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <ul class="long">
        <li><div>The Python programming language allows a programmer to
        specify a default value for a function parameter. When a
        parameter has a default value, the corresponding argument is
        optional. The prepare content for lesson 4 includes a section
        about <a href="../lesson04/prepare.html#default_params">default
        parameter values</a>.</div></li>

        <li><div><p>Within a Python program, when a number is passed as
        an argument to a function, the computer copies the number from
        the argument into the parameter. In other words, the parameter
        gets a copy of the value that is in the argument. Copying the
        value of an argument into a parameter is known as <dfn>pass by
        value</dfn>.</p>

        <p>In Python, when a list is passed as an argument to a
        function, the computer does <em>not</em> copy the list. Instead,
        the computer copies a reference to the list into the parameter.
        This means the argument and parameter refer to the same list.
        Copying a reference from an argument into a parameter is known
        as <dfn>pass by reference</dfn>. With pass by reference, if a
        called function changes a list that was passed to the function,
        this will of course change the list in both the calling and
        called functions because both the argument and parameter refer
        to the same list.</p>

    <p>As a team, write a Python program named
    <code>random_numbers.py</code> that creates a list of numbers,

    </ol>

    <p>At the bottom of your program, write an if <code>statement</code>

        <code>test_random_numbers.py</code> file and ensure that the
        <code>test_random_numbers</code> function passes. If it doesn't
        pass, there is a mistake in your <code>random_numbers</code>

    <h2 id="l07_teach_solution">Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your solution to the
    <a class="solution" href="teach_solution.py">sample solution</a>.
    Please <strong>do not look at the sample solution</strong> until you
    have either finished the program or diligently worked for at least
    one hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling to
    complete the assignment, you may use the sample solution to help you
    finish.</p>

    <h2 id="l07_teach_ponder">Ponder</h2>
    <p>Look again at the <code>append_random_numbers</code> function
    (and the <code>append_random_words</code> function if you wrote it
    for the stretch challenge). The first parameter,
    <var>numbers_list</var>, is a list. Recall that in Python, lists are
    passed by reference which means that any changes made to the list in
    the <code>append_random_numbers</code> (and
    <code>append_random_words</code>) function will change the list in
    <code>main</code>. You can verify this is true by looking at the
    output of your program. The numbers that were appended onto the list
    by the <code>append_random_numbers</code> function are stored in the
    same list in <code>main</code>.</p>

    <h2 id="l07_teach_submit">Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>

    <h1>07 Prove Milestone: Lists</h1>

    <h2 id="l07_prove_purpose">Purpose</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a Python program that creates and uses a
    compound list.</p>

    <h2 id="l07_prove_problem">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>In chemistry, the <dfn>molar mass</dfn> of a substance is the
    mass in grams of one mole of the substance (grams / mole). A
    <dfn>mole</dfn> is simply a fixed very large quantity, specifically
    602,214,076,000,000,000,000,000 (usually written as 6.02214076
    &times; 10<sup>23</sup>). A molar mass calculator is a program that
    computes the molar mass of a substance and the number of moles of a
    sample of that substance. To use a molar mass calculator, a chemist
    enters two inputs:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><div>The formula for a molecule, such as H<sub>2</sub>O
        (water) or C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>
        (glucose)</div></li>
        <li><div>The mass in grams of a sample of the substance, such as
        3.71</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The calculator computes the molar mass of the molecule by doing
    the following for each element in the formula:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Sum the number of atoms of each element in the
        formula</div></li>
        <li><div>Find the atomic mass of each element</div></li>
        <li><div>Multiply the number of atoms by their atomic
        mass</div></li>
        <li><div>Add the product into the molar mass of the
        molecule</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Then the calculator uses this formula to compute the number of
    moles in the sample:</p>
    <div class="block formula"><var>number_of_moles</var> = <div class="fract"><div><var>sample_mass</var></div><div><var>molar_mass</var></div></div></div>

    <p>Finally, the calculator prints two results for the chemist to
    see:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>the molar mass</div></li>
        <li><div>the number of moles</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="l07_prove_example">Example</h3>
    <p>As an example, consider a sample of glucose
    (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) with a mass of 12.37
    grams. To use a molar mass calculator, a chemist would enter</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div><span class="input">C6H12O6</span></div></li>
        <li><div><span class="input">12.37 grams</span></div></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The calculator would compute the molar mass of glucose by doing
    the following:</p>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Sum the number of atoms of each element in the
        formula for glucose:<br>
        6 carbon atoms<br>
        12 hydrogen atoms<br>
        6 oxygen atoms</div></li>

        <li><div>Find the atomic mass of each element:
            <table><thead>
                <tr><th>Symbol</th> <th>Name</th> <th>Atomic Mass</th></tr>
            </thead><tbody>
                <tr><td>C</td> <td>Carbon</td> <td>12.0107</td></tr>
                <tr><td>H</td> <td>Hydrogen</td> <td>1.00794</td></tr>
                <tr><td>O</td> <td>Oxygen</td> <td>15.9994</td></tr>
            </tbody></table>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Multiply the number of atoms by their atomic mass:
            <table><tbody>
                <tr><td class="number">6</td> <td>&times;</td>
                    <td>12.0107</td> <td>=</td> <td>72.0642</td></tr>
                <tr><td class="number">12</td> <td>&times;</td>
                    <td>1.00794</td> <td>=</td> <td>12.09528</td></tr>
                <tr><td class="number">6</td> <td>&times;</td>
                    <td>15.9994</td> <td>=</td> <td>95.9964</td></tr>
            </tbody></table>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Add the results of the multiplications to get the molar mass
        of glucose:
        <div>72.0642 + 12.09528 + 95.9964 = 180.15588 grams/mole</div>
        </div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Then the calculator would divide the mass of the sample of
    glucose by the molar mass of glucose which results in the
    number of moles in the sample:</p>
    <div class="block formula"><div class="fract"><div>12.37 grams</div><div>180.15588 grams/mole</div></div> = 0.06866 moles</div>

    <p>The calculator would then print two results for the chemist to
    see:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>the molar mass of glucose: 180.15588
        grams/mole</div></li>
        <li><div>the number of moles in the sample: 0.06866
        moles</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="l07_prove_elements">Table of Elements</h3>
    <p>There are 94 elements known to occur naturally on earth. The
    symbol, name, and atomic mass of all 94 elements are shown in the
    following table.</p>

    <h2 id="l07_prove_steps">Steps</h2>
    <p>Do the following:</p>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Using VS Code, create a new file and save it as
        <code>chemistry.py</code></div></li>

        <li><div>In the <code>chemistry.py</code> file, write a function
        named <code>make_periodic_table</code> that takes no parameters
        and creates and returns a compound list. The compound list must
        contain all the data in the table of elements shown in the
        Problem Statement section above. The data within the compound
        list must be organized like this:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
    periodic_table_list = [
        # [symbol, name, atomic_mass]
        ["Ac", "Actinium", 227],
        ["Ag", "Silver", 107.8682],
        ["Al", "Aluminum", 26.9815386],
          &vellip;
    ]</pre></div>
        We <strong>strongly recommend</strong> that you <strong>do not
        type the data</strong> in the table of elements but instead that
        you use <strong>copy and paste</strong> to copy the data from
        this assignment into your program. If you don't know how to use
        copy and paste to help you quickly write the
        <code>make_periodic_table</code> function, ask a fellow student,
        a tutor, a teaching assistant, or your teacher for
        help.</div></li>

        <li><div>In the <code>chemistry.py</code> file, write the
        <code>main</code> function that takes no parameters and returns
        nothing. The <code>main</code> function should do the following:
        <ol>
            <li><div>Call the <code>make_periodic_table</code>
            function and store the returned list in a
            variable.</div></li>
            <li><div>Print the name and atomic mass for each chemical
            element on a separate line. Do not print the chemical
            element symbols.</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>

        <li><div>At the bottom of your <code>chemistry.py</code> file,

        Python file and save it in the same folder where you saved your
        <code>chemistry.py</code> program. Run the
        <code>test_chemistry_1.py</code> file and ensure that the
        <code>test_make_periodic_table</code> function passes. If it
        doesn't pass, there is a mistake in your
        <code>make_periodic_table</code> function. Read the output from
        <code>pytest</code>, fix the mistake, and run the
        <code>test_chemistry_1.py</code> file again until the test
        function passes.

    <h1>08 Prepare: Dictionaries</h1>
    <p>In this lesson, you will learn how to store data in and retrieve
    data from Python dictionaries. You will also learn how to write a
    loop that processes all the items in a dictionary.</p>

    <h2 id="l08_prepare_video">Video</h2>
    <p>Watch this video about dictionaries in Python.</p>
    <ul class="videos">
        <li><div><a href="https://realpython.com/lessons/dictionary-python/">Dictionaries</a> <span class="duration">(6 minutes)</span></div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="l08_prepare_concepts">Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn during this lesson:</p>

    <h3 id="l08_prepare_dicts">Dictionaries</h3>
    <p>A Python program can store many items in a <dfn>dictionary</dfn>.
    Each <dfn>item</dfn> in a dictionary is a key value pair. Each
    <dfn>key</dfn> within a dictionary must be unique. In other words,
    no key can appear more than once in a dictionary. Values within a
    dictionary do not have to be unique. Dictionaries are mutable,
    meaning they can be changed after they are created. Dictionaries
    were invented to enable computers to find items quickly.</p>

    <p>The following table represents a dictionary that contains five
    items (five key value pairs) Notice that each of the keys is
    unique.</p>

    <table class="center"><thead>
        <tr><th colspan="2">items</th> <th></th></tr>
        <tr><th>keys</th> <th>values</th> <th></th></tr>
    </thead><tbody>
        <tr><td>42-039-4736</td> <td>Clint Huish</td>
            <td class="center">&uarr;</td></tr>
        <tr><td>61-315-0160</td> <td>Amelia Davis</td>
            <td class="center">|</td></tr>
        <tr><td>10-450-1203</td> <td>Ana Soares</td>
            <td class="center">5 items</td></tr>
        <tr><td>75-421-2310</td> <td>Abdul Ali</td>
            <td class="center">|</td></tr>
        <tr><td>07-103-5621</td> <td>Amelia Davis</td>
            <td class="center">&darr;</td></tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p>We can create a dictionary by using curly braces
    ({&nbsp;and&nbsp;}). We can add an item to a dictionary and find an
    item in a dictionary by using square brackets ([&nbsp;and&nbsp;])
    and a key. The following code example shows how to create a
    dictionary, add an item, remove an item, and find an item in a
    dictionary.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l08_prepare_ex1"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 1

def main():
    # Create a dictionary with student IDs as
    # the keys and student names as the values.
    students = {
        "42-039-4736": "Clint Huish",
        "61-315-0160": "Amelia Davis",
        "10-450-1203": "Ana Soares",
        "75-421-2310": "Abdul Ali",
        "07-103-5621": "Amelia Davis"
    }

    # Add an item to the dictionary.
    <em>students["81-298-9238"] = "Sama Patel"</em>

    # Remove an item from the dictionary.
    students.pop("61-315-0160")

    # Get the number of items in the dictionary and print it.
    length = len(students)
    print(f"length: {length}")

    # Print the entire dictionary.
    print(students)
    print()

    # Get a student ID from the user.
    id = input("Enter a student ID: ")

    # Check if the student ID is in the dictionary.
    if id in students:

        # Find the student ID in the dictionary and
        # retrieve the corresponding student name.
        <em>name = students[id]</em>

        # Print the student's name.
        print(name)

    else:
        print("No such student")

    <p><span class="cross" data-ref="l08_prepare_ex1">Line&nbsp;15</span> in the

    <p><span class="cross" data-ref="l08_prepare_ex1">Line&nbsp;32</span> in the
    previous code example, uses the Python membership operator, which is
    the keyword <code>in</code>, to check if a key is stored in a

    that follows this template:</p>

    <p><span class="cross" data-ref="l08_prepare_ex1">Line&nbsp;36</span> in the

    follows this template.</p>

    <h3 id="l08_prepare_compound_vals">Compound Values</h3>
    <p>A <dfn>simple value</dfn> is a value that doesn't contain parts,
    such as an integer. A <dfn>compound value</dfn> is a value that has
    parts, such as a list. In example&nbsp;1 above, the
    <var>students</var> dictionary has simple keys and values. Each key
    is a single string, and each value is a single string. It is
    possible to store compound values in a dictionary. Example&nbsp;2
    shows a <var>students</var> dictionary where each value is a Python
    list. Because each list contains multiple parts, we say that the
    dictionary stores compound values.</p>

    <h3 id="l08_prepare_findOne">Finding One Item</h3>
    <p>The reason Python dictionaries were developed is to make finding
    items easy and fast. As explained in example&nbsp;1, to find an item
    in a dictionary, a programmer needs to write just one line of code
    that follows this template:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">    <var>value</var> = <var>dictionary_name</var>[<var>key</var>]</pre></div>

    <p>That one line of code will cause the computer to search the
    dictionary until it finds the <var>key</var>. Then the computer will
    return the <var>value</var> that corresponds to the <var>key</var>.
    Some students forget how easy it is to find items in a dictionary,
    and when asked to write code to find an item, they write complex
    code like
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l08_prepare_ex3">lines&nbsp;24&ndash;28</span>
    in example&nbsp;3.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l08_prepare_ex3"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 3

def main():
    # Create a dictionary with student IDs as the keys
    # and student data stored in a list as the values.
    students = {
        # student_ID: [given_name, surname, email_address, credits]
        "42-039-4736": ["Clint", "Huish", "hui20001@byui.edu", 16],
        "61-315-0160": ["Amelia", "Davis", "dav21012@byui.edu", 3],
        "10-450-1203": ["Ana", "Soares", "soa22005@byui.edu", 15],
        "75-421-2310": ["Abdul", "Ali", "ali20003@byui.edu", 5],
        "07-103-5621": ["Amelia", "Davis" "dav19008@byui.edu", 0]
    }

    # Get a student ID from the user.
    id = input("Enter a student ID: ")

    <em># This is a difficult and slow way to find an item in a
    # dictionary. Don't write code like this to find an item
    # in a dictionary!</em>

    # For each item in the dictionary, check if
    # its key is the same as the variable id.
    student = None
    for key, value in students.items(): <em># Bad example!</em>
        if key == id:                   <em># Don't use a loop like</em>
            student = value             <em># this to find an item</em>
            break                       <em># in a dictionary.</em>
</pre></div>

    <p>Compare the <code>for</code> loop at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l08_prepare_ex3">lines&nbsp;24&ndash;28</span> in
    the previous example to this one line of code.</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">    value = students[id]</pre></div>

    <p>Clearly, writing one line of code is easier for a programmer than
    writing the <code>for</code> loop. Not only is the one line of code
    easier to write, but the computer will execute it much, much faster
    than the <code>for</code> loop. Therefore, when you need to write
    code to find an item in a dictionary, don't write a loop. Instead,
    write one line of code that uses the square brackets
    ([&nbsp;and&nbsp;]) and a key to find an item. Example&nbsp;4 shows
    the correct way to find an item in a dictionary.</p>

    <h3 id="l08_prepare_lists_to_dict">Converting between Lists and Dictionaries</h3>
    <p>It is possible to convert two lists into a dictionary by using
    the built-in <code>zip</code> and <code>dict</code> functions. The
    contents of the first list will become the keys in the dictionary,
    and the contents of the second list will become the values. This
    implies that the two lists must have the same length, and the
    elements in the first list must be unique because keys in a
    dictionary must be unique.</p>

    <p>It is also possible to convert a dictionary into two lists by
    using the <code>keys</code> and <code>values</code> methods and the

    <h2 id="l08_prepare_summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>A dictionary in a Python program can store many pieces of data
    called items. An item is a key value pair. Each key that is stored
    in a dictionary must be unique. Values do not have to be unique. To
    create a dictionary, we use curly braces ({&nbsp;and&nbsp;}). To add
    an item and find an item in a dictionary, we use the square brackets
    ([&nbsp;and&nbsp;]) and a key. To process all items in a dictionary,
    we write a <code>for</code> each loop. Dictionaries were invented to
    enable a computer to find items very quickly. Do not write a for
    each loop to find an item in a dictionary. To find an item in a
    dictionary, use square brackets ([&nbsp;and&nbsp;]) and a key.</p>

    <h1>08 Team Activity: Dictionaries</h1>

    <h2 id="l08_teach_instrucs">Instructions</h2>
    <p>Work as a team as explained in the instructions for the
    <a href="../lesson02/teach.html#instrucs">lesson&nbsp;2 team
    activity</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="l08_teach_problem">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints uses lots of
    computer technology to collect and store family history data,
    including data about individuals and marriages. Interestingly, the
    data about individuals must be stored separately from the data about
    marriages because some individuals get married multiple times.
    However, in order to make the data understandable to people, when a
    person views marriage data, a program must combine the marriage data
    and the individual data.</p>

    <h2 id="l08_teach_helpful_docs">Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <ul class="tutorials long">
        <li><div>The <a href="../lesson07/prepare.html">prepare content
        for the previous lesson</a> explains how to retrieve an element
        from a list.</div></li>

        in a dictionary.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="l08_teach_assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>As a team, write a Python program that stores data about
    individuals in one dictionary and stores data about marriages in a
    different dictionary. Your program must combine the data in the two
    dictionaries and print the combined data so that it is understandable
    to a user. Start your program by downloading and saving the
    <a download href="family_history.py"><code>family_history.py</code></a>
    Python file and then open it in VS Code and complete the Core
    Requirements.</p>

    <h3 id="l08_teach_required">Core Requirements</h3>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Within your program, the <code>print_death_age</code>
        function must print the name and age at death for each person in
        the people dictionary.</div></li>

        <li><div>The <code>count_genders</code> function must count and
        print the number of males and the number of females in the
        people dictionary.</div></li>

        <li><div>The <code>print_marriages</code> function must print
        the following for each marriage in the marriages dictionary:
        <ol>
            <li><div>The name and age in the wedding year of the
            husband</div></li>
            <li><div>The year of the wedding</div></li>
            <li><div>The name and age in the wedding year of the
            wife</div></li>
        </ol>
        </div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="l08_teach_stretch">Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an
    hour, complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that
    the stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Add code to the <code>print_death_age</code> function
        that prints the birth year and death year for each
        person.</div></li>

        <!--
        <li><div>Add to your program a function named
        <code>print_marriages_for_person</code> that asks the user for a
        person key. Then the function should print the person's name and
        for all the marriages of that person, print the wedding year and
        spouse's name. If there are no marriages in the marriage
        dictionary for the person specified by the user, the function
        should print, "No marriage data." Recall that a person_key
        begins with the letter "P" and has three digits after the
        "P".</div></li>
        -->

        <li><div>Add to your program a function named
        <code>count_marriages</code> that counts and prints the number
        of marriages that each person had in his or her lifetime.
        According to the data, who married the most times?</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="l08_teach_testing">Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="test">
        <li><div>Run your <code>family_history.py</code> program and
        verify that it prints the same results as shown below.

        The code that you pasted includes a <code>FormulaError</code>

        them are complete and work correctly, and you should not change
        them. The <code>parse_formula</code> function converts a
        chemical formula for a molecule, such as "C13H16N2O2"
        (melatonin), into a compound list, such as
        <span class="nowrap">[["C", 13], ["H", 16], ["N", 2], ["O", 2]].</span>
        In the code that you pasted, this compound list is known as a

        of chemical elements and the quantity of each element that
        appears in a chemical formula.</div></li>

        <li><div>The code that you pasted also includes the header and
        documentation string for a function named
        <code>compute_molar_mass</code>. Read the docstring and comments
        in the <code>compute_molar_mass</code> function and write the
        code for that function. Note that you can complete the
        <code>compute_molar_mass</code> function by writing ten or fewer
        lines of code.</div></li>

        <li><div>Modify the <code>main</code> function in your

    <p>If your program fulfills the requirements for this assignment as
    described in the previous prove milestone and the Assignment section
    above, your program will earn 93% of the possible points. In order
    to earn the remaining 7% of points, you will need to add one or more
    features to your program so that it exceeds the requirements. Here
    are a few suggestions for additional features that you could add to
    your program if you wish.</p>

    <ul class="long">
        <li><div>Add a dictionary that contains known chemical formulas
        and their names. For example:

    <h1>09 Prepare: Text Files</h1>
    <p>Most computers permanently store lots of data on devices such as
    hard drives, solid state drives, and thumb drives. The data that is
    stored on these devices is organized into files. Just as a human can
    write words on a paper, a computer can store words and other data in
    a file. During this lesson, you will learn how to write Python code
    that reads text from text files.</p>

    <h2 id="l09_prepare_concepts">Concepts</h2>
    <p>Broadly speaking, there are two types of files: text files and
    binary files. A <dfn>text file</dfn> stores words and numbers as
    human readable text. A <dfn>binary file</dfn> stores pictures,
    diagrams, sounds, music, movies, and other media as numbers in a
    format that is not directly readable by humans.</p>

    <h3 id="l09_prepare_text_files">Text Files</h3>
    <p>In order to read data from a text file, the file must exist on
    one of the computer's drives, and your program must do these three
    things:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Open the file for reading text</div></li>
        <li><div>Read from the file, usually one line of text at a
        time</div></li>
        <li><div>Close the file</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>The built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open"><code>open</code> function</a>
    opens a file for reading or writing. Here is an excerpt
    from the official documentation for the <code>open</code>
    function:</p>

    <dl class="function">
        <dt><pre class="python">open(filename, mode="rt")</pre></dt>
        <dd><p>Open a file and return a corresponding file
        object.</p>
        <p><var>filename</var> is the name of the file to be
        opened.</p>
        <p><var>mode</var> is an optional string that specifies the
        mode in which the file will be opened. It defaults to
        <code>"rt"</code> which means open for reading in text mode.
        Other common values are <code>"wt"</code> for writing a text
        file (truncating the file if it already exists), and
        <code>"at"</code> for appending to the end of a text
        file.</p></dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Example&nbsp;1 contains a program that opens a text file named
    <a download="download" href="plants.txt"><code>plants.txt</code></a>
    for reading at <span class="cross" data-ref="l09_prepare_ex1">line&nbsp;26</span>.
    At <span class="cross" data-ref="l09_prepare_ex1">line&nbsp;30</span> there is a
    <code>for</code> loop that reads the text in the file one line at a
    time and repeats the body of the for loop once <code>for</code> each
    line of text in the file. In the body of the <code>for</code> loop
    at lines&nbsp;<span class="cross" data-ref="l09_prepare_ex1">32&ndash;38</span>,
    the code removes surrounding white space, if there is any, from each
    line of text and then stores each line of text in a list.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l09_prepare_ex1"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 1

def main():
    # Read the contents of a text file

    <p>After the body of a <code>for</code> loop that reads from a
    file, we can write a call to the <code>file.close</code> method.
    However, when calling the <code>open</code> function, most
    programmers use a <code>with</code> block as shown in example&nbsp;1
    at <span class="cross" data-ref="l09_prepare_ex1">line&nbsp;26</span> and nest
    the <code>for</code> loop inside the <code>with</code> block as
    shown at
    lines&nbsp;<span class="cross" data-ref="l09_prepare_ex1">30&ndash;38</span>.
    When the <code>with</code> block ends, the computer will
    automatically close the file, so that the programmer doesn't have to
    write a call to the <code>file.close</code> method.</p>

    <h3 id="l09_prepare_csv_files">CSV Files</h3>
    <p>Many computer systems import and export data in CSV files. CSV is
    an acronym for comma separated values. A <dfn>CSV file</dfn> is a
    text file that contains tabular data with each row on a separate
    line of the file and each cell (column) separated by a comma. The
    following example shows the contents of a CSV file named
    <a download href="hymns.csv"><code>hymns.csv</code></a> that stores
    data about religious songs. Notice that the first row of the file
    contains column headings, the next four rows contain data about four
    hymns, and each row contains three columns separated by commas.</p>

    <p>Python has a standard
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html">module named <code>csv</code></a>
    that includes functionality to read from and write to CSV files. The
    program in example&nbsp;2 shows how to open a CSV file and use the
    <code>csv</code> module to read the data and print it to a terminal
    window. In example&nbsp;2 at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l09_prepare_ex2">line&nbsp;8</span>, there is a
    call to the Python built-in <code>open</code> function, which opens
    the <code>hymns.csv</code> file for reading.
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l09_prepare_ex2">At line&nbsp;12</span>, the
    program creates a <code>csv.reader</code> object that will read from
    the <code>hymns.csv</code> file. Within the <code>for</code> loop at
    lines&nbsp;<span class="cross" data-ref="l09_prepare_ex2">16 and&nbsp;17</span>

    <p>When a <code>csv.reader</code> reads a row from a CSV file, the
    reader returns the row as a list of strings. The output from
    example&nbsp;2 shows that a <code>csv.reader</code> returns a list
    of strings. In the output, notice the five lists of strings,
    (strings surrounded by square brackets [&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;]) that
    were printed by the print statement at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l09_prepare_ex2">line&nbsp;17</span>. Notice also
    that the reader reads all the rows from a CSV file, including the
    first row, which contains column headings.</p>

    <p>You might recall that in CSE&nbsp;110, you wrote a program that
    reads from a CSV file without using a <code>csv.reader</code>. That
    program split each row of text from the CSV file using the string
    <code>split</code> method. Unfortunately, using the
    <code>split</code> method will not work for all CSV files. Consider
    the following <code>hymns.csv</code> file that contains rows for the
    hymns "Far, Far Way on Judea's Plains" and "Oh, Come, All Ye
    Faithful". Both of these hymns have commas in their titles. If we
    use the string <code>split</code> method to separate the columns in
    this CSV file, the hymn titles will be split. A
    <code>csv.reader</code> will correctly split rows in all valid CSV
    files.</p>

    <h3 id="l09_prepare_process_rows">Processing Each Row in a CSV File</h3>
    <p>After reading each row from a CSV file, the <code>for</code> loop
    in the previous example simply prints the row list to a terminal
    window. Of course, a <code>for</code> loop can do much more than
    simply print each row. Consider the following CSV file named
    <a download href="dentists.csv"><code>dentists.csv</code></a>
    that stores data about dental offices. Notice that the first row of
    the file contains column headings, the next four rows contain data
    about four dental offices, and each row contains five columns
    separated by commas.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="csv">

    <p>The program in example&nbsp;3 processes each row in the
    <code>dentists.csv</code> file to determine which dental office has
    the most patients per employee. Notice that the first row of the
    <code>dentists.csv</code> file contains column headings. The
    headings contain no numbers and aren't needed for the calculations,
    so the program skips the first row by calling the built-in

    <h2 id="l09_prepare_summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>A text file stores words and numbers as human readable text.
    During this lesson, you are learning how to write Python code to
    read from text files. To read from a text file, your program must
    first open the file by calling the built-in <code>open</code>
    function. You should write the code to open a file in a Python
    <code>with</code> block because the computer will automatically
    close the file when the <code>with</code> block ends, and you won't
    need to remember to write code to close the file.</p>

    <p>A CSV file is a text file that contains rows and columns of data.
    CSV is an acronym that stands for comma separated values. Within
    each row in a CSV file, the data values are separated by commas.
    Python includes a standard module named <code>csv</code> that helps
    us easily write code to read from CSV files. Sometimes a program
    simply needs to use the values in a CSV file in calculations, so we
    write Python code to perform calculations for each row. Other times,
    we write Python code to read the contents of a CSV file into a
    compound list or compound dictionary.</p>

    <h1>Writing Text Files</h1>

    <h2 id="l09_write_text_text_files">Text Files</h2>
    <p>Broadly speaking, there are two types of files: text files and
    binary files. A <dfn>text file</dfn> stores words and numbers as
    human readable text. A <dfn>binary file</dfn> stores pictures,
    diagrams, sounds, music, movies, and other media as numbers in a
    format that is not directly readable by humans.</p>

    <h3 id="l09_write_text_write">Writing into a Text File</h3>
    <p>In order to write text to a file, a program must call the
    built-in <code>open</code> function to open the file for writing or
    appending text and then call the <code>.write</code> method or the
    built-in <code>print</code> function. Example&nbsp;1 contains a
    program that asks the user for an inspirational quote and then
    appends that quote to a text file. At
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l09_write_text_ex1">line&nbsp;8</span>, the program
    calls the built-in open <code>function</code>, and at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l09_write_text_ex1">line&nbsp;11</span>, the program
    calls the built-in <code>print</code> function.</p>

    <h2 id="l09_write_text_summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>A text file stores words and numbers as human readable text.
    To write text into file, your program must first open the file by
    calling the built-in <code>open</code> function. You should write
    the code to open a file in a Python <code>with</code> block because
    the computer will automatically close the file when the
    <code>with</code> block ends, and you won't need to remember to
    write code to close the file. To write text to an open text file,
    your program can call the built-in <code>print</code> function with
    the <code>file</code> named argument.</p>

    <p>A CSV file is a text file that contains rows and columns of data.
    CSV is an acronym that stands for comma separated values. Within
    each row in a CSV file, the data values are separated by commas.
    Python includes a standard module named <code>csv</code> that helps
    us easily write Python code to write to a CSV file.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2 id="l09_check_assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>You must do the following to setup VS Code so that your program
    can read from a text file:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Download the
        <a download href="provinces.txt"><code>provinces.txt</code></a>
        file and save it in the same folder where you will save your
        Python program.</div></li>

        <li><div>Using VS Code, open the folder where you saved the
        <code>provinces.txt</code> file by doing the following:
        <ul>
            <li><div>On a computer running the <dfn>Mac OSX</dfn>
            operating system:
            <ol>
                <li><div>Click the "File" menu, then "Open..."</div></li>
                <li><div>Find and select the folder where you saved the
                <code>provinces.txt</code> file.</div></li>
                <li><div>Click the "Open" button.</div></li>
            </ol></div></li>

            <li><div>On a computer running the <dfn>Windows</dfn>
            operating system:
            <ol>
                <li><div>Click the "File" menu, then "Open
                Folder..."</div></li>
                <li><div>Find and select the folder where you saved the
                <code>provinces.txt</code> file.</div></li>

            </ol></div></li>
        </ul></div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Now that you have correctly setup VS Code so that your program
    can read the <code>provinces.txt</code> file, open that file in VS
    Code and examine it. Notice that the file contains a list of names
    of Canadian Provinces. Notice also that the file contains "AB"
    several times which is an abbreviation for Alberta.</p>

    <p>Write a Python program named <code>provinces.py</code> that reads
    the contents of <code>provinces.txt</code> into a list and then
    modifies the list. Your program must do the following:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Open the <code>provinces.txt</code> file for
        reading.</div></li>

        <li><div>Read the contents of the file into a list where each
        line of text in the file is stored in a separate element in the
        list.</div></li>

        <li><div>Print the entire list.</div></li>

        <li><div>Remove the first element from the list.</div></li>

        <li><div>Remove the last element from the list.</div></li>

        <li><div>Replace all occurrences of "AB" in the list with
        "Alberta".</div></li>

        <li><div>Count the number of elements that are "Alberta" and
        print that number.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="l09_check_testing">Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each
    step in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="test">
        <li><div>Run your program and ensure that your program's output
        matches the output below. (Your program may wrap the

    <h1>09 Prove Milestone: Text Files</h1>

    <h2 id="l09_prove_purpose">Purpose</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a Python program that reads CSV files
    and creates, populates, and uses a dictionary.</p>

    <h2 id="l09_prove_problem">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>A local grocery store subscribes to an online service that
    enables its customers to order groceries online. After a customer
    completes an order, the online service sends a CSV file that
    contains the customer's requests to the grocery store. The store
    needs you to write a program that reads the CSV file and prints to
    the terminal window a receipt that lists the purchased items and
    shows the subtotal, the sales tax amount, and the total.</p>

    <h2 id="l09_prove_assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>During this milestone, you will write half of a Python program
    named <code>receipt.py</code> that prints to the terminal window a
    receipt for a customer's grocery order. Specifically, by the end of
    this milestone, your program must contain at least these two
    functions:
    <ol>
        <li><div><code>main</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>read_dictionary</code></div></li>
    </ol>
    <p>and must read and process these two CSV files:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>The <code>products.csv</code> file is a catalog of
            all the products that the grocery store sells.</div></li>
        <li><div>The <code>request.csv</code> file contains the items
            ordered by a customer.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="l09_prove_helpful_docs">Helpful Documentation</h2>

        similar to this prove assignment.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="l09_prove_tutor">Help from a Tutor</h2>
    <p>As a BYU-Idaho campus or online student you can get help from a
    tutor to complete your CSE 111 assignments. Each tutor is a current
    BYU-Idaho student employed by BYU-Idaho. Meeting with a tutor is
    free. It will not cost you any money to meet with a tutor. To get
    help from a tutor, you simply make an appointment and then meet with
    the tutor. Campus students meet with tutors in the tutoring center.
    Online students meet with tutors in Zoom. To make an appointment,
    follow the instructions in the
    <a href="https://courses.byui.edu/AcademicSupport/tutoring-center/online-tutoring/online-courses-tutoring-guide.pdf">course tutoring guide</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="l09_prove_steps">Steps</h2>
    <p>Do the following:</p>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Download both of these files:
        <a download href="products.csv"><code>products.csv</code></a> and
        <a download href="request.csv"><code>request.csv</code></a> and
        save them in the same folder where you will save your Python
        program.</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the <code>products.csv</code> file in VS Code and
        examine it. Notice that each row in this file contains three
        values separated by commas: a product number, a product name,
        and a retail price. Also, notice that each product number in the
        <code>products.csv</code> file is unique. This means that your
        program can read the <code>products.csv</code> file into a
        dictionary and use the product numbers as keys in the
        dictionary.</div></li>

        <li><div>In VS Code, create a new file and save it as
        <code>receipt.py</code> in the same folder where you saved the
        <code>products.csv</code> and <code>request.csv</code>
        files.</div></li>

        <li><div><p>In <code>receipt.py</code>, write a function named
        <code>read_dictionary</code> that will open a CSV file for
        reading and use a <code>csv.reader</code> to read each row and
        populate a compound dictionary with the contents of the
        <code>products.csv</code> file. The read_dictionary function
        must have this header and documentation string:</p>

    <div class="pre"><pre class="python">def read_dictionary(filename, key_column_index):
    """Read the contents of a CSV file into a compound
    dictionary and return the dictionary.

    Parameters
        filename: the name of the CSV file to read.
        key_column_index: the index of the column
            to use as the keys in the dictionary.
    Return: a compound dictionary that contains
        the contents of the CSV file.
    """</pre></div>

        <p>Recall that each item in a dictionary has a key and a value.
        Each item in the <var>products</var> dictionary must have a
        product number as the key and a list with the product number,
        product name, and price as the value as shown in the following
        table.</p>

        <table class="center"><thead>
            <tr><th colspan="2">Products</th></tr>
            <tr><th>Key</th> <th>Value</th></tr>
        </thead><tbody>
            <tr><td>"D150"</td> <td>["D150", "1 gallon milk", 2.85]</td></tr>
            <tr><td>"D083"</td> <td>["D083", "1 cup yogurt", 0.75]</td></tr>
            <tr><td>"P143"</td> <td>["P143", "1 lb baby carrots", 1.39]</td></tr>
            <tr><td>"W231"</td> <td>["W231", "32 oz granola", 3.21]</td></tr>
            <tr><td>"W112"</td> <td>["W112", "wheat bread", 2.55]</td></tr>
            <tr><td>"C013"</td> <td>["C013", "twix candy bar", 0.85]</td></tr>
            <tr><td class="center">&vellip;</td> <td class="center">&vellip;</td></tr>
        <tbody></table></div></li>

        <li><div>Open the <code>request.csv</code> file in VS Code and
        examine it. Notice that each row contains only two values, a
        product number and a quantity. Notice also that product number
        D083 appears twice in the file. It appears twice because the
        customer who created the order in the <code>request.csv</code>
        file added four yogurts to his order and then later added three
        more yogurts to his order. Because product numbers may appear
        multiple times in the <code>request.csv</code> file, your
        program must not read the contents of <code>request.csv</code>
        into a dictionary.</div></li>

        <li><div>In your <code>receipt.py</code> program, write another
        function named <code>main</code> that does the following:
        <ol>
            <li><div>Calls the <code>read_dictionary</code> function and
            stores the compound dictionary in a variable named
            <var>products_dict</var>.</div></li>

            <li><div>Prints the <var>products_dict</var>.</div></li>

            <li><div>Opens the <code>request.csv</code> file for
            reading.</div></li>

            <li><div>Skips the first line of the
            <code>request.csv</code> file because the first line
            contains column headings.</div></li>

            <li><div>Uses a loop that reads and processes each row from
            the <code>request.csv</code> file. Within the body of the
            loop, your program must do the following for each row:
            <ol>
                <li><div>Use the requested product number to find the
                corresponding item in the <var>products_dict</var>.</div></li>
                <li><div>Print the product name, requested quantity, and
                product price.</div></li>
            </ol></div></li>
        </ol>

        <p>Because product number D083 appears twice in the
        <code>request.csv</code> file, your program must not read the
        <code>request.csv</code> file into a dictionary. Recall that
        each key in a dictionary is unique. If your program reads the
        <code>request.csv</code> file into a dictionary, when your
        program reads line 3 of the <code>request.csv</code> file, your
        program will put a request for four yogurts into the dictionary.
        Then when your program reads line 6 of the
        <code>request.csv</code> file, your program will replace the
        request for four yogurts with a request for three yogurts. In
        other words, if your program reads the <code>request.csv</code>
        file into a dictionary, your program will think that the
        customer ordered only three yogurts instead of the seven
        <span class="nowrap">(4 + 3)</span> that he ordered. Therefore,
        your program must not read the <code>request.csv</code> file
        into a dictionary but should instead read and process each row
        similar to <a href="prepare.html#ex3">example&nbsp;3</a> in the
        prepare content for this lesson.</p>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>At the bottom of your <code>receipt.py</code> file,
        add a call to the <code>main</code> function. Be certain to
        protect the call to <code>main</code> with an <code>if</code>
        statement as taught in the
        <a href="../lesson05/prepare.html#separate">prepare content
        for lesson&nbsp;5</a>.</div></li>

        <code>test_products.py</code> file and ensure that the
        <code>test_read_dictionary</code> function passes. If it doesn't
        pass, there is a mistake in your <code>read_dictionary</code>
        function. Read the output from <code>pytest</code>, fix the

    <h1>10 Prepare: Handling Exceptions</h1>
    <p>Errors and exceptional situations sometimes occur while a program
    is running. Such errors include a program attempting to read from a
    file that doesn't exist, a connection error when connecting to a
    server on a network, data that cannot be found on a server, and
    calculations that produce undefined results. A well written program
    doesn't crash when an error occurs but instead handles errors in a
    graceful manner that may include adjusting to an error, printing an
    error message for the user to see, and saving an error message to a
    log file. During this lesson, you will learn to write code that
    handles errors that may occur while your Python program is
    running.</p>

    <h2 id="l10_prepare_concepts">Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn during this lesson.</p>

    <h3 id="l10_prepare_exception">What Is an Exception?</h3>
    <p>An <dfn>exception</dfn> is a relatively rare event that sometimes
    occurs while a Python program is running. For example, an exception
    occurs when a Python program tries to open a file for reading, and
    that file doesn't exist. There are many different
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html">built-in
    exceptions</a> that may occur while a Python program is running.</p>

    <p>When an exceptional event occurs, a Python function
    <dfn>raises</dfn> an exception which may be handled by code at
    another location in the executing Python program. The Python keyword
    to raise an exception is <code>raise</code>. Normally, you will not
    need to write code to raise an exception because the built-in
    functions, such as <code>open</code>, <code>int</code>, and
    <code>float</code>, will raise an exception when necessary. You will
    need to write code in your programs to handle exceptions.</p>

    <h3 id="l10_prepare_handle_except">How to Handle an Exception</h3>
    <p>The Python keywords to handle exceptions are <code>try</code>,
    <code>except</code>, <code>else</code>, and <code>finally</code>.
    The following example code contains the outline of a complete
    try-except-else-finally block. Read the code and its comments
    carefully to understand the correct syntax and organization of a
    try-except-else-finally block.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l10_prepare_ex1"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 1

<em>try</em>:
    # Write normal code here. This block must include
    # code that falls into two groups:
    # 1. Code that may cause an exception to be raised
    # 2. Code that depends on the results of the code
    #    in the first group
<em>except ZeroDivisionError as zero_div_err:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in the try
    # block caused a function to raise a ZeroDivisionError.
<em>except ValueError as val_err:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in the
    # try block caused a function to raise a ValueError.
<em>except (TypeError, KeyError, IndexError) as error:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in the
    # try block caused a function to raise a TypeError,
    # KeyError, or IndexError.
<em>except Exception as excep:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in the try
    # block caused a function to raise any exception that
    # was not handled by one of the previous except blocks.
<em>except:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in the
    # try block caused a function to raise anything that
    # was not handled by one of the previous except blocks.
<em>else:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes after the code
    # in the try block if the code in the try block
    # did not cause any function to raise an exception.
<em>finally:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes after all the other
    # code in try, except, and else blocks regardless of
    # whether an exception was raised or not.</pre></div>

    <p>As shown in example&nbsp;1 above, when we want to write code that
    will handle exceptions, we first write a <code>try</code> block, and
    we put into that <code>try</code> block the normal code that might
    cause an exception. Then we write <code>except</code> blocks to
    handle the exceptions. Each <code>except</code> block may handle one
    type of exception like the code at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l10_prepare_ex1">line&nbsp;9</span>:</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">except ZeroDivisionError as zero_div_err:</pre></div>

    <p>Or each <code>except</code> block may handle several types of
    exceptions, like the code at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l10_prepare_ex1">line&nbsp;15</span>:</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">except (TypeError, KeyError, IndexError) as error:</pre></div>

    <p>Or one <code>except</code> block may handle all possible types of
    exceptions, like the code at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l10_prepare_ex1">line&nbsp;19</span>:</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">except Exception as excep:</pre></div>

    <p>Or a bare <code>except</code> block may handle anything that can
    be raised, including <code>SystemExit</code>,
    <code>KeyboardInterrupt</code> and <code>GeneratorExit</code>, like
    the code at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l10_prepare_ex1">line&nbsp;23</span>:</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">except:</pre></div>

    <p>The Python programming language requires us to order
    <code>except</code> blocks from most specific at the top to least
    specific (most general) at the bottom. However, in most programs, it
    is a bad idea to write <code>except</code> blocks that are very
    general, including an <code>except</code> block that handles all
    possible exception types
    (<span class="cross" data-ref="l10_prepare_ex1">line&nbsp;19</span>)
    and a bare <code>except</code> block
    (<span class="cross" data-ref="l10_prepare_ex1">line&nbsp;23</span>).</p>

    <p>It is usually a bad idea to write an <code>except</code> block that
    handles all types of exceptions or a bare except block because such
    a block will handle <code>SyntaxError</code>. Normally, a program
    should not handle <code>SyntaxError</code>. Instead, a program
    should crash for a syntax error and print the line number where the
    syntax error occurred so that a programmer can find and fix the
    syntax error. As explained in the
    <a href="../lesson06/prepare.html#err_types">prepare content</a>
    for lesson 6, syntax errors are caused by a programmer mistyping
    code and not by bad user input or missing files. A programmer
    should find and fix all syntax errors in a program long before the
    program is given to users, so there is no reason to handle syntax
    errors in an <code>except</code> block.</p>

    <p>As shown at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l10_prepare_ex1">line&nbsp;27</span> in
    example&nbsp;1 above, following the <code>except</code> blocks, a
    programmer may write an optional <code>else</code> block which the
    computer will execute if the <code>try</code> block does not raise
    any exceptions. It is uncommon to need to write code in the
    <code>else</code> block of <code>try</code> and <code>except</code>,
    and professional programmers almost never do it.</p>

    <p>As shown at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l10_prepare_ex1">line&nbsp;31</span> in
    example&nbsp;1 above, at the end of the exception handling code, a
    programmer may write an optional <code>finally</code> block. The
    <code>finally</code> block contains code that the computer executes
    after all the other code in the <code>try</code>,
    <code>except</code>, and <code>else</code> blocks regardless of
    whether an exception was raised or not. The code in the
    <code>finally</code> block usually contains "clean up" code that
    frees resources that the code in the <code>try</code> block used.
    For example, if the code in the <code>try</code> block opens a file,
    the code in the <code>finally</code> block could close that file. In
    CSE&nbsp;111, you won't need to write a <code>finally</code>
    block.</p>

    <h2 id="l10_prepare_except_types">Common Exception Types</h2>
    <p>There are many different types of
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html">built-in
    exceptions</a> that may occur while a Python program is running.
    This section shows how seven types of exceptions may occur.</p>

    <h3 id="l10_prepare_type_err">TypeError</h3>
    <p>The computer raises a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError"><code>TypeError</code></a>
    when the code that calls a function passes an argument with the
    wrong data type. The code in example&nbsp;2 attempts to pass a
    string to the <code>round</code> function. This causes the computer
    to raise a <code>TypeError</code> because the <code>round</code>
    function cannot round a string to an integer. It can round only a
    number to an integer. The output below example&nbsp;2 shows that the
    computer raised a <code>TypeError</code>.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l10_prepare_ex2"><pre class="python"># Example 2

def main():
    try:
        text = input("Please enter a number: ")
        integer = round(text)
        print(integer)

    except TypeError as type_err:
        print(type_err)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="l10_prepare_ex2">&gt; python type_error.py
Please enter a number: <span class="input">25.7</span>
type str doesn't define __round__ method</pre>

    <h3 id="l10_prepare_value_err">ValueError</h3>
    <p>The computer raises a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError"><code>ValueError</code></a>
    when the code that calls a function passes an argument with the
    correct data type but with an invalid value. A common event that
    causes the computer to raise a <code>ValueError</code> is when the
    <code>int</code> function or <code>float</code> function tries to
    convert a string to a number but the string contains characters that
    are not digits. The code in example&nbsp;3 and its output show a
    <code>ValueError</code>.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l10_prepare_ex3"><pre class="python"># Example 3

def main():
    try:
        number = float(input("Please enter a number: "))
        print(number)

    except ValueError as val_err:
        print(val_err)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="l10_prepare_ex3">&gt; python value_error.py
Please enter a number: <span class="input">45.7u</span>
could not convert string to float: '45.7u'</pre>

    <h3 id="l10_prepare_zero_div_err">ZeroDivisionError</h3>
    <p>The computer raises a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ZeroDivisionError"><code>ZeroDivisionError</code></a>
    when a program attempts to divide a number by zero (0) as shown in
    example&nbsp;4 and its output.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l10_prepare_ex4"><pre class="python"># Example 4

def main():
    try:
        players = int(input("Enter the number of players: "))
        teams = int(input("Enter the number of teams: "))

        players_per_team = players / teams

        print(f"Each team should have {players_per_team} players")

    except ZeroDivisionError as zero_div_err:
        print(zero_div_err)

if __name__ == "__main__":

    <h3 id="l10_prepare_index_err">IndexError</h3>
    <p>Recall from <a href="../lesson07/prepare.html">lesson&nbsp;7</a>
    that each element in a list is stored at a unique index and that an
    index is always an integer. If we write code that tries to use an
    index that doesn't exist in a list, when the computer executes that
    code, the computer will raise an
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndexError"><code>IndexError</code></a>.
    The program in example&nbsp;5 creates a list that contains three
    surnames. Then the program attempts to change the surname at
    index&nbsp;3. Of course, the list contains only three elements, and
    the index of the last element is 2, so the statement fails and
    causes the computer to raise an <code>IndexError</code>.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l10_prepare_ex5"><pre class="python"># Example 5

def main():
    try:
        # Create a list that contains three family names.
        surnames = ["Smith", "Lopez", "Marsh"]

        # Attempt to change the surname at index 3. Because
        # there are only three names in the surnames list and
        # therefore the last index is 2, this statement will
        # fail and cause the computer to raise an IndexError.

    <p>The program in example&nbsp;6 is similar to example&nbsp;5, and
    both programs cause the computer to raise an
    <code>IndexError</code>. The program in example&nbsp;6 creates a
    list that contains three surnames. Then the program attempts to
    print the surname at index&nbsp;3. Of course, this statement fails

    <p>As shown in example&nbsp;7, if we write code that attempts to

    <p>Of course, it is very unlikely that a programmer would write a
    program that tries to find a hard-coded key that is not in a
    dictionary. However, it is common for a user to enter a key that is
    not in a dictionary. This is why the programs in
    <a href="../lesson08/prepare.html#ex1">examples&nbsp;1</a>
    <a href="../lesson08/prepare.html#ex4">and&nbsp;4</a> in the prepare
    content for lesson&nbsp;8 include an <code>if</code> statement
    above the line of code that searches the dictionary, like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
    # Get a student ID from the user.
    id = input("Enter a student ID: ")

    # Check if the student ID is in the dictionary.

    <h3 id="l10_prepare_file_not_found_err">FileNotFoundError</h3>
    <p>If we write a call to the <code>open</code> function that
    attempts to open a file for reading and that file doesn't exist, the
    computer will raise a
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#FileNotFoundError"><code>FileNotFoundError</code></a>.

    <p>Nearly all computer operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows,
    Mac OS X, and Linux, allow multiple people to use a single computer.
    Because people need to store private data in files on a computer,
    the operating systems implement file access permission rules. These
    rules help to prevent unauthorized access to files.</p>

    <p>If we write a call to the <code>open</code> function that

    <p>If the concepts above seem vague, these tutorials may clear some
    confusion for you:</p>

    </ul>

    <p>The official Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#bltin-exceptions">built-in
    exceptions reference</a> contains a list of all the built-in
    exceptions. It also includes the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy">class
    hierarchy</a> for the built-in exceptions that is helpful for
    ordering <code>except</code> blocks from most specific to most
    general.</p>

    <h2 id="l10_prepare_summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>Errors and exceptional situations sometimes occur while a program
    is running. When an exceptional situation occurs, a computer will
    raise an exception. With the <code>try</code> and <code>except</code>
    keywords, you can write Python code that will handle exceptions.
    Write normal program code inside a <code>try</code> block and write
    an <code>except</code> block for each type of exception that you
    want your program to handle.</p>

    <p>There are many types of exceptions in Python, but there are only
    seven types that your code will need to handle in
    CSE&nbsp;111: <code>TypeError</code>, <code>ValueError</code>,
    <code>ZeroDivisionError</code>, <code>IndexError</code>,
    <code>KeyError</code>, <code>FileNotFoundError</code>, and
    <code>PermissionError</code>. When writing code that writes to or
    reads from a file, a programmer usally writes <code>try</code> and
    <code>except</code> blocks to handle <code>FileNotFoundError</code>
    and <code>PermissionError</code>. Also, when writing code that gets
    input from a user, a programmer usually writes <code>try</code> and
    <code>except</code> blocks to help validate the user's input.</p>

    <h1>10 Team Activity: Handling Exceptions</h1>

    <h2 id="l10_teach_instrucs">Instructions</h2>
    <p>Work as a team as explained in the instructions for the
    <a href="../lesson02/teach.html#instrucs">lesson&nbsp;2 team
    activity</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="l10_teach_problem">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Every year in the United States, thousands of people are killed
    and millions more are injured in traffic accidents on the nation's
    roads and highways. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety
    Administration (NHTSA) maintains
    <a href="https://cdan.nhtsa.gov/tsftables/tsfar.htm">data about the
    accidents</a>, including a list of factors contributing to each
    accident.</p>

    <p>The CSV file <code>accidents.csv</code> contains summary data
    from the NHTSA about the accidents that occurred on U.S. roads and
    highways during the years 2010 through 2017. <code>accidents.py</code>
    is a Python program that uses the data to estimate how many lives
    would have been saved and injuries avoided if drivers had stopped
    dangerous behavior such as speeding and using cell phones while
    driving.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, <code>accidents.py</code> does not contain any
    code to validate the input that the user enters while the program is
    running. Add exception handling code to <code>accidents.py</code> to
    validate the user's input and print helpful error messages when the
    user enters incorrect input.</p>

    <h2 id="l10_teach_helpful_docs">Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <ul class="mixed long">
        <li class="tutorial"><div>The <a href="prepare.html">prepare
        content</a> for this lesson explains how to wrap
        <code>try</code> and <code>except</code> around a normal block
        of code. It also includes an example that shows how to
        <a href="prepare.html#validate_input">validate user input</a>
        within a loop.</div></li>

        shows a BYU-Idaho faculty member adding a <code>try</code> block
        and <code>except</code> blocks to a program to handle errors
        that might occur while the program is executing.</div></li>

    </ul>

    <h2 id="l10_teach_assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>Do the following:</p>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Download and save both
        <a download href="accidents.csv"><code>accidents.csv</code></a> and
        <a download href="accidents.py"><code>accidents.py</code></a> in
        the same folder.</div></li>

        <li><div>Open <code>accidents.csv</code> in VS Code or another
        editor and notice that it contains ten columns and eight rows of
        data regarding traffic accidents in the United
        States.</div></li>

        <li><div>Open <code>accidents.py</code> in VS Code and notice
        that lines&nbsp;21&ndash;22 contain code to ask the user for a
        filename and then open that file. It is possible that when the
        computer executes line&nbsp;21, the user may enter the name of a
        file that does not exist or may enter the name of a file that
        the user does not have permission to read. These two situations
        cause the computer to raise a <code>FileNotFoundError</code> or
        <code>PermissionError</code> when the computer tries to open the
        file at line&nbsp;22.</div></li>

        <li><div>Notice that lines&nbsp;25&ndash;26 of
        <code>accidents.py</code> contains code to prompt the user for a
        number. It is possible that while the computer is executing
        lines&nbsp;25&ndash;26, the user may enter text that is not a
        number, for example: "4r0". This situation causes the computer
        to raise a <code>ValueError</code>. It is also possible that the
        user may enter a number that is too low or too high, for
        example: -15 or 701234932. In this situation, the computer does
        not raise an exception, but this situation is still a mistake
        that the program should alert the user about.</div></li>

        <li><div>Notice that lines&nbsp;45&ndash;55 of
        <code>accidents.py</code> contain code to process each line of
        the CSV file. It is possible that the CSV file is formatted
        incorrectly which would cause the computer to raise
        <code>csv.Error</code>. It is also possible that one of the rows
        in the CSV file contains zero (0) in the "Fatal Crashes" column.
        This would cause the computer to raise
        <code>ZeroDivisionError</code> at line&nbsp;75 within the
        <code>estimate_reduction</code> function.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="l10_teach_required">Core Requirements</h3>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Add exception handling code that prints a useful error
        message when the computer raises <code>FileNotFoundError</code>
        or <code>PermissionError</code>.</div></li>

        <li><div>Add exception handling code that prints a useful error
        message when the computer raises <code>ValueError</code> while
        it is converting the percentage entered by the user to a
        float.</div></li>

        <li><div>Add code that prints a useful error message when the
        user enters a percentage that is less than 0 or greater than
        100. Hint: you could add an <code>if</code> statement
        immediately after the line of code that gets the percentage from
        the user.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="l10_teach_stretch">Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an
    hour, complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that
    the stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Add exception handling code to handle
        <code>ZeroDivisionError</code> that might be raised by the
        <code>estimate_reduction</code> function. This exception
        handling code should print a useful error message that includes
        the filename and line number of the line that contains zero (0)
        in the "Fatal Crashes" column.</div></li>

        <li><div>Add exception handling code to handle
        <code>csv.Error</code> that might be raised by the
        <code>csv</code> module. This exception handling code should
        print a useful error message that includes the filename and line
        number of the line that is formatted incorrectly.</div></li>

        <li><div>Test <em>all</em> of your error handling code,
        including the code that handles <code>ZeroDivisionError</code>
        and <code>PermissionError</code>. To test
        <code>ZeroDivisionError</code>, you could temporarily change
        one of the numbers in the "Fatal Crashes" column of
        <code>accidents.csv</code> to zero (0). To test
        <code>PermissionError</code>, you could create a CSV file or a
        simple text file and then use File Explorer or Finder to change
        the permissions on that file so that your account doesn't have
        permission to read that file.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="l10_teach_testing">Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="test">
        <li><div>Run the <code>accidents.py</code> program and enter the
        inputs shown below. Verify that the exception handling code that
        you added to <code>accidents.py</code> prints error messages as
        shown below.

    <h1>10 Prove Assignment: Handling Exceptions</h1>

    <h2 id="l10_prove_purpose">Purpose</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a Python program that handles
    exceptions, including FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, and
    KeyError.</p>

    <h2 id="l10_prove_problem">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>A local grocery store subscribes to an online service that
    enables its customers to order groceries online. After a customer
    completes an order, the online service sends a CSV file that
    contains the customer's requests to the grocery store. The store
    needs you to write a program that reads the CSV file and prints to
    the terminal window a receipt that lists the purchased items and
    shows the subtotal, the sales tax amount, and the total.</p>

    <h2 id="l10_prove_assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>During the prove milestone for the previous lesson, you wrote the
    part of this program that reads and processes two CSV files, one
    named <code>products.csv</code> that contains a catalog of products
    and one named <code>request.csv</code> that contains a customer's
    order. During this prove assignment, you will add code to finish
    printing a receipt and to handle any exceptions that might occur
    while your program is running. Specifically, your program must do
    the following:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Print the store name at the top of the receipt.</div></li>
        <li><div>Print the list of ordered items.</div></li>
        <li><div>Sum and print the number of ordered items.</div></li>
        <li><div>Sum and print the subtotal due.</div></li>
        <li><div>Compute and print the sales tax amount. Use 6% as the
        sales tax rate.</div></li>
        <li><div>Compute and print the total amount due.</div></li>
        <li><div>Print a thank you message.</div></li>
        <li><div>Get the current date and time from your computer's
        operating system and print the current date and time.</div></li>
        <li><div>Include a <code>try</code> block and
        <code>except</code> blocks to handle
        <code>FileNotFoundError</code>, <code>PermissionError</code>,
        and <code>KeyError</code>.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="l10_prove_helpful_docs">Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <ul class="long">
        <li><div>The <a href="../lesson09/prove.html">prove milestone</a>
        of the previous lesson describes the two CSV files that your
        program must process.</div></li>

        <li><div>The <a href="prepare.html">prepare content</a> for this
        lesson explains how to handle exceptions.</div></li>

        <li><div>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.now"><code>datetime.now() method</code></a>
        from the standard Python <code>datetime</code> module
        will get the current date and time from your computer's
        operating system. Here is an excerpt from the official
        documentation for the <code>datetime.now</code> method:
        <dl class="function">
            <dt><pre class="python">datetime.now(tz=None)</pre></dt>
            <dd>Return the current local date and time.
            <p><var>tz</var> is optional, but if it is not
            <code>None</code>, it must be a <code>tzinfo</code> (time
            zone information) object</p></dd>
        </dl>

        <p>These two Microsoft videos explain how to use methods from
        the standard <code>datetime</code> module.</p>
        <ul class="videos">
            <li><div><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Intro-to-Python-Development/Python-for-Beginners-15-of-44-Date-Data-Types">Date data types</a> <span class="duration">(8 minutes)</span></div></li>

        </ul>

        <p>The following Python code imports the <code>datetime</code>
        class from the <code>datetime</code> module and calls the
        <code>datetime.now</code> method to get the current date and
        time from a computer's operating system. Then it uses an
        f-string to format and print the current date and time.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l10_prove_ex1"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Import the datetime class from the datetime
# module so that it can be used in this program.
from datetime import datetime

# Call the now() method to get the current
# date and time as a datetime object from
# the computer's operating system.
current_date_and_time = datetime.now()

# Use an f-string to print the current
# day of the week and the current time.
print(f"{current_date_and_time:%A %I:%M %p}")</pre></div>

        <p>After the computer executes
        <span class="cross" data-ref="l10_prove_ex1">line&nbsp;8</span> in the
        above code, the variable <var>current_date_and_time</var> will
        hold the current date and time. Within the f-string at
        <span class="cross" data-ref="l10_prove_ex1">line&nbsp;12</span>,
        the string sequences that begin with the percent symbol (%) are
        called format codes. The
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes">format codes and their meaning</a>
        are listed in the official Python <code>datetime</code>
        reference</a>. When executed, the previous example code will
        print the current date and time to the terminal window like
        this:</p>

<pre class="console" data-for="l10_prove_ex1">&gt; python example_1.py

    </ul>

    <h2 id="l10_prove_tutor">Help from a Tutor</h2>
    <p>As a BYU-Idaho campus or online student you can get help from a
    tutor to complete your CSE 111 assignments. Each tutor is a current
    BYU-Idaho student employed by BYU-Idaho. Meeting with a tutor is
    free. It will not cost you any money to meet with a tutor. To get
    help from a tutor, you simply make an appointment and then meet with
    the tutor. Campus students meet with tutors in the tutoring center.
    Online students meet with tutors in Zoom. To make an appointment,
    follow the instructions in the
    <a href="https://courses.byui.edu/AcademicSupport/tutoring-center/online-tutoring/online-courses-tutoring-guide.pdf">course tutoring guide</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="l10_prove_testing">Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>

    <ol class="test long">
        <li><div>Run your program and verify that it prints a receipt
        formatted similarly to the one shown below. Your program must
        print the current date and time with exactly the same formatting
        as shown below. Also, verify that your program computes the
        number of items, subtotal, sales tax, and total as shown below.

<pre class="console">&gt; python receipt.py
Inkom Emporium

wheat bread: 2 @ 2.55
1 cup yogurt: 4 @ 0.75
32 oz granola: 1 @ 3.21
twix candy bar: 2 @ 0.85
1 cup yogurt: 3 @ 0.75

Number of Items: 12
Subtotal: 15.26
Sales Tax: 0.92
Total: 16.18

Thank you for shopping at the Inkom Emporium.
Wed Nov  4 05:10:30 2020</pre>
        </div></li>

        <li><div><p>Verify that the <code>except</code> block to handle
        <code>KeyError</code> that you added to your program works
        correctly by doing the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><div>Temporarily add the following line to the end of
            your <code>requests.csv</code> file and then save the file.
<div class="pre"><pre class="csv">R002,5</pre></div>
            </div></li>
            <li><div>Run your program again and verify that it prints an
            error message like the one shown below.
<pre class="console">&gt; python receipt.py
Error: unknown product ID in the request.csv file
'R002'</pre>
            Hint: if you wrote an <code>except</code> block in your
            program to handle <code>KeyError</code> and added "R002,5"
            to the <code>requests.csv</code> file and saved the
            <code>requests.csv</code> file and ran your program but your
            program isn't raising a <code>KeyError</code>, then look in
            your program to see if you wrote an <code>if</code>
            statement before the statement that finds a value in the
            <var>products</var> dictionary. Look for code similar to
            this:

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">    <em>if prod_num in products_dict:</em>
        prod_info_list = products_dict[prod_num]
        &vellip;</pre></div>

            If your program contains an <code>if</code> statement
            similar to the one above, then the <code>if</code> statement
            is probably preventing your program from raising a
            <code>KeyError</code>. Delete the <code>if</code> statement
            and unindent the lines of code inside the <code>if</code>
            statement and test your program again.
            </div></li>
        </ol>
        </div></li>

        <li><div><p>Verify that the <code>except</code> block to handle
        <code>FileNotFoundError</code> that you added to your program
        works correctly by doing the following:</p>
        <ol class="long">
            <li><div>Temporarily delete or rename the
            <code>products.csv</code> file.</div></li>
            <li><div>Run your program again and verify that it prints an
            error message like the one shown below.
<pre class="console">&gt; python receipt.py
Error: missing file
[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'products.csv'</pre>
            </div></li>
        </ol>
        </div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="l10_prove_exceed">Exceeding the Requirements</h2>
    <p>If your program fulfills the requirements for this assignment as
    described in the previous prove milestone and the Assignment section
    above, your program will earn 93% of the possible points. In order
    to earn the remaining 7% of points, you will need to add one or more
    features to your program so that it exceeds the requirements. Here
    are a few suggestions for additional features that you could add to
    your program if you wish.</p>

    <ul class="long">
        <li><div>Write code to discount the product prices by 10% if
        today is Tuesday or Wednesday.</div></li>
        <li><div>Write code to discount the product prices by 10% if the
        current time of day is before 11:00 a.m.</div></li>
        <li><div>Write code to print a coupon at the bottom of the
        receipt. Write the code so that it will always print a coupon
        for one of the products ordered by the customer.</div></li>
        <li><div>Write code to print at the bottom of the receipt an
        invitation for the customer to complete an online
        survey.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="l10_prove_submit">Submission</h2>
    <p>To submit your program, return to I-Learn and do these two
    things:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Upload your program (the .py file) for feedback.</div></li>
        <li><div>Add a submission comment that specifies the grading
        category that best describes your program along with a one or

    <h1>11 Prepare: Functional Programming</h1>
    <p>A <dfn>paradigm</dfn> is a way of thinking or a way of perceiving
    the world. There are at least four main paradigms for programming a
    computer: procedural, declarative, functional, and object-oriented.
    During previous lessons in CSE&nbsp;110 and&nbsp;111, you used
    procedural programming. During this lesson, you will be introduced
    to functional programming.</p>

    <p><dfn>Procedural programming</dfn> is a programming paradigm that
    focuses on the process or the steps to accomplish a task. This is
    the type of programming that you did in CSE&nbsp;110 and in previous
    lessons of CSE&nbsp;111.</p>

    <p><dfn>Declarative programming</dfn> is a programming paradigm that
    does <em>not</em> focus on the process or steps to accomplish a
    task. Instead, with declarative programming, a programmer focuses on
    what she wants from the computer, or in other words, she focuses on
    the desired results. The SQL programming language is a good example
    of a declarative language. If you have ever written SQL code, then
    you have used declarative programming. When writing SQL code, a
    programmer writes code to tell the computer what she wants in the
    results but not the steps the computer must follow to get those
    results.</p>

    <p><dfn>Functional programming</dfn> is a programming paradigm that
    focuses on functions and avoids shared state, mutating state, and
    side effects. There are many techniques and concepts that are part
    of functional programming. However, in this lesson we will focus on
    just three, namely:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>We can pass a function into another function.</div></li>
        <li><div>A nested function is a function defined inside another
        function.</div></li>
        <li><div>A lambda function is a small anonymous function.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="l11_prepare_concepts">Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the functional programming concepts that you should
    learn during this lesson.</p>

    <h3 id="l11_prepare_pass_func">Passing a Function into another Function</h3>
    <p>The Python programming language allows a programmer to pass a
    function as an argument into another function. A function that
    accepts other functions in its parameters is known as a
    <dfn>higher-order function</dfn>. Higher-order functions are often
    used to process the elements in a list. Before seeing an example of
    using a higher-order function to process a list, first consider the
    program in example&nbsp;1 that doesn't use a higher-order function
    but instead uses a <code>for</code> loop to convert a list of
    temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l11_prepare_ex1"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 1

def main():
    fahr_temps = [72, 65, 71, 75, 82, 87, 68]

    # Print the Fahrenheit temperatures.
    print(f"Fahrenheit: {fahr_temps}")

    # Convert each Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius and store
    # the Celsius temperatures in a list named cels_temps.
    cels_temps = []
    <em>for fahr in fahr_temps:
        cels = cels_from_fahr(fahr)
        cels_temps.append(cels)</em>

    # Print the Celsius temperatures.
    print(f"Celsius: {cels_temps}")


def cels_from_fahr(fahr):
    """Convert a Fahrenheit temperature to
    Celsius and return the Celsius temperature.
    """
    cels = (fahr - 32) * 5 / 9
    return round(cels, 1)


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="l11_prepare_ex1">&gt; python example_1.py
Fahrenheit: [72, 65, 71, 75, 82, 87, 68]
Celsius: [22.2, 18.3, 21.7, 23.9, 27.8, 30.6, 20.0]</pre>

    <p>At <span class="cross" data-ref="l11_prepare_ex1">lines&nbsp;12&ndash;14</span>
    in example&nbsp;1, there is a <code>for</code> loop that converts
    each Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius and then appends the Celsius
    temperature onto a new list. Writing a <code>for</code> loop like
    this is the traditional way to process all the elements in a list
    and doesn't use higher-order functions.</p>

    <p>Python includes a built-in higher-order function named
    <code>map</code> that will process all the elements in a list and
    return a new list that contains the results. The
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map"><code>map</code> function</a>
    accepts a function and a list as arguments and contains a loop
    inside it, so that when a programmer calls the <code>map</code>
    function, he doesn't need to write a loop. The <code>map</code>
    function is a higher-order function because it accepts a function as
    an argument. Consider the program in example&nbsp;2 that produces
    the same results as example&nbsp;1.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l11_prepare_ex2"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 2

def main():
    fahr_temps = [72, 65, 71, 75, 82, 87, 68]

    # Print the Fahrenheit temperatures.
    print(f"Fahrenheit: {fahr_temps}")

    # Convert each Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius and store
    # the Celsius temperatures in a list named cels_temps.
    cels_temps = list(<em>map(cels_from_fahr, fahr_temps)</em>)

    # Print the Celsius temperatures.
    print(f"Celsius: {cels_temps}")


def cels_from_fahr(fahr):
    """Convert a Fahrenheit temperature to
    Celsius and return the Celsius temperature.
    """
    cels = (fahr - 32) * 5 / 9
    return round(cels, 1)


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="l11_prepare_ex2">&gt; python example_2.py
Fahrenheit: [72, 65, 71, 75, 82, 87, 68]
Celsius: [22.2, 18.3, 21.7, 23.9, 27.8, 30.6, 20.0]</pre>

    <p>Notice that example&nbsp;2, doesn't contain a <code>for</code>
    loop. Instead, at <span class="cross" data-ref="l11_prepare_ex2">line&nbsp;11</span>,
    it contains a call to the <code>map</code> function. Remember that
    the <code>map</code> function has a loop inside it, so that the
    programmer who calls <code>map</code>, doesn't have to write the
    loop. Notice also at <span class="cross" data-ref="l11_prepare_ex2">line&nbsp;11</span>
    that the first argument to the <code>map</code> function is the name
    of the <code>cels_from_fahr</code> function. In other words, at
    line&nbsp;11, we are passing the <code>cels_from_fahr</code>
    function into the <code>map</code> function, so that
    <code>map</code> will call <code>cels_from_fahr</code> for each

    <p>The <code>map</code> function is just one example of a
    higher-order function. Python also includes the built-in
    higher-order
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted"><code>sorted</code></a>
    and
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter"><code>filter</code></a>

    <h3 id="l11_prepare_nested_func">Nested Functions</h3>
    <p>The Python programming language allows a programmer to define
    nested functions. A <dfn>nested function</dfn> is a function that is
    defined inside another function and is useful when we wish to split
    a large function into smaller functions and the smaller functions
    will be called by the containing function only. The program in
    example&nbsp;3 produces the same results as examples&nbsp;1
    and&nbsp;2, but it uses a nested function. Notice in example&nbsp;3
    at <span class="cross" data-ref="l11_prepare_ex3">lines&nbsp;5&ndash;10</span>
    that the <code>cels_from_fahr</code> function is nested inside the
    <code>main</code> function.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l11_prepare_ex3"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 3

def main():

    <em>def cels_from_fahr(fahr):
        """Convert a Fahrenheit temperature to
        Celsius and return the Celsius temperature.
        """
        cels = (fahr - 32) * 5 / 9
        return round(cels, 1)</em>

    fahr_temps = [72, 65, 71, 75, 82, 87, 68]

    # Print the Fahrenheit temperatures.
    print(f"Fahrenheit: {fahr_temps}")

    # Convert each Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius and store
    # the Celsius temperatures in a list named cels_temps.
    cels_temps = list(map(cels_from_fahr, fahr_temps))

    # Print the Celsius temperatures.

    <h3 id="l11_prepare_lambda_func">Lambda Functions</h3>
    <p id="l11_prepare_lambda">A Python <dfn>lambda function</dfn> is a small
    anonymous function, meaning a small function without a name. A
    lambda function is always a small function because the Python
    language restricts a lambda function to just one expression.
    Consider the program in example&nbsp;4 which is yet another example
    program that converts Fahrenheit temperatures to Celsius. Notice the
    lambda function at <span class="cross" data-ref="l11_prepare_ex4">line&nbsp;12</span>
    of example&nbsp;4. It takes one parameter named <var>fahr</var> and
    computes and returns the corresponding Celsius temperature. At
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l11_prepare_ex4">line&nbsp;16</span>, the lambda
    function is passed into the <code>map</code> function.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l11_prepare_ex4"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 4

def main():
    fahr_temps = [72, 65, 71, 75, 82, 87, 68]

    # Print the Fahrenheit temperatures.
    print(f"Fahrenheit: {fahr_temps}")

    # Define a lambda function that converts
    # a Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius and
    # returns the Celsius temperature.
    cels_from_fahr = <em>lambda fahr: round((fahr - 32) * 5 / 9, 1)</em>

    # Convert each Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius and store
    # the Celsius temperatures in a list named cels_temps.
    cels_temps = list(<em>map(cels_from_fahr, fahr_temps)</em>)

    # Print the Celsius temperatures.
    print(f"Celsius: {cels_temps}")


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="l11_prepare_ex4">&gt; python example_4.py
Fahrenheit: [72, 65, 71, 75, 82, 87, 68]
Celsius: [22.2, 18.3, 21.7, 23.9, 27.8, 30.6, 20.0]</pre>

    <p>Some students are confused by the statement that a lambda
    function is an anonymous function (a function without a name).
    Looking at the lambda function in example&nbsp;4 at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l11_prepare_ex4">line&nbsp;12</span>, it appears
    that the lambda function is named <var>cels_from_fahr</var>.
    However, <var>cels_from_fahr</var> is the name of a variable, not
    the name of the lambda function. The lambda function has no name.
    This distinction may seem trivial until we see an example of an
    inline lambda function. Notice in the next example that the lambda
    function is defined inside the parentheses for the call to the
    <code>map</code> function.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
    # Convert each Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius and store
    # the Celsius temperatures in a list named cels_temps.
    cels_temps = list(map(
            <em>lambda fahr: round((fahr - 32) * 5 / 9, 1)</em>,
            fahr_temps))
</pre></div>

        <p>To write a lambda function write code that follows this
        template:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
    lambda <var>param1</var>, <var>param2</var>, &hellip; <var>paramN</var>: <var>expression</var></pre></div>

    <p>As shown in the template, type the keyword <code>lambda</code>,
    then parameters separated by commas, then a colon (:), and finally
    an expression that performs arithmetic, modifies a string, or
    computes something else.</p>

    <p>In Python, every lambda function can be written as a regular
    Python function. For example, the lambda function in example&nbsp;4
    can be rewritten as the <code>cels_from_fahr</code> function in
    examples&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2, and&nbsp;3.</p>

    <h2 id="l11_prepare_map_filter">Example - Map and Filter</h2>
    <p>The <a href="../lesson09/check.html">checkpoint</a> for
    lesson&nbsp;9 required you to write a program that replaced all the
    occurrences of "AB" in a list with the name "Alberta" and then
    counted how many times the name "Alberta" appeared in the list.</p>

    <h2 id="l11_prepare_sort_list">Example - Sorting a Compound List</h2>
    <p>Python includes a built-in higher-order function named
    <code>sorted</code> that accepts a list as an argument and returns a
    new sorted list. Calling the <code>sorted</code> function is
    straightforward for a simple list such as a list of strings or a
    list of numbers as shown in example&nbsp;6 and its output.</p>

    <p>A <dfn>compound list</dfn> is a list that contains lists. Sorting
    a compound list is more complex than sorting a simple list. Consider
    this compound list that contains data about some countries.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
    # Create a list that contains data about countries.
    countries = [
        # [country_name, land_area, population, gdp_per_capita]

    ]</pre></div>

    <p>Perhaps we want the <var>countries</var> compound list sorted by
    country name or perhaps we want it sorted by population. The element
    that we want a list sorted by is known as the <dfn>key
    element</dfn>. If we want to use the <code>sorted</code> function to
    sort a compound list, we must tell the <code>sorted</code> function
    which element is the key element, which we do by passing a small
    function as an argument into the <code>sorted</code> function. This
    small function is called the <dfn>key function</dfn> and extracts
    the key element from a list as shown in example&nbsp;7.</p>

    <p>Notice at <span class="cross" data-ref="l11_prepare_ex7">line&nbsp;26</span>

    <p>By using a key function it's possible to sort a compound list
    with a key element that isn't in the list. Consider the compound
    list named <var>students</var> that contains data about various
    students in example&nbsp;8. Within the list, each student's
    given name and surname are stored separately. It is common for a
    user to want such a list to be sorted by surname and then by
    given name. A simple way to do that is to write a key function
    that combines the surname and given name elements and returns
    the combined name as the key that the <code>sorted</code> function
    will use for sorting.</p>

    <p><span class="cross" data-ref="l11_prepare_ex8">Lines&nbsp;21&ndash;22</span>

    dashes in this format: "ddd-ddd-dddd" where each <var>d</var> is a
    digit. The first three digits are called the area code. For example,
    for many years, 208 was the area code for all phone numbers in the
    state of Idaho and 801 and 435 were the two area codes for phone
    numbers in the state of Utah. Some people, when entering their phone
    number, will not enter the area code and assume that other people
    will know the correct area code.</p>

    <h2 id="l11_check_assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>Write a program named <code>add_area_code.py</code> that reads
    phone numbers from a text file. Your program must add the area code
    "208-" to all phone numbers that don't have an area code. Do the
    following:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Download these two files:
        <a download href="phone_numbers.txt">phone_numbers.txt</a> and
        <a download href="add_area_code.py">add_area_code.py</a>
        and save them in the same folder.</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the <code>phone_numbers.txt</code> file in VS Code
        and examine the phone numbers. Notice that some of the phone
        numbers do not have an area code and contain only seven
        digits.</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the <code>add_area_code.py</code> file in VS Code.
        Read the comments in the program and then add code to the
        program so that it does the following:
        <ol>
            <li><div>Reads the phone numbers in
            <code>phone_numbers.txt</code> into a list.</div></li>
            <li><div>Adds the area code "208-" to the phone numbers that
            do not have an area code.</div></li>
            <li><div>Prints the list with the corrected phone
            numbers.</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="l11_check_testing">Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>

    <ol class="test long">
        <li><div>Download, examine, and run this Python file named
        <a download href="test_add_area_code.py"><code>test_add_area_code.py</code></a>
        that contains <code>pytest</code> test functions. Verify that
        all the test functions pass. If they don't pass, fix the
        mistakes in your <code>add_area_code</code> function until they
        pass.</div></li>

        <li><div>Run your program, which should print the list of
        corrected phone numbers as shown below. Examine the corrected
        phone numbers printed by your program and verify that all of
        them have an area code.

    <p>In the <code>main</code> function, look at the line of code that
    calls the <code>map</code> function. Think about the fact that the
    <code>map</code> function will call the <code>add_area_code</code>
    function once for each element in the <var>phone_numbers</var> list,
    and the <code>add_area_code</code> function will add the area code
    "208-" at the beginning of each phone number if necessary.</p>

    <h2 id="l11_check_solution">Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>When your program is finished, view the <a class="solution"
    href="check_solution.py">sample solution</a> for this assignment to
    compare your solution to that one. Before looking at the sample
    solution, you should work to complete this checkpoint program.
    However, if you have worked on it for at least an hour and are still
    having problems, feel free to use the sample solution to help you
    finish your program.</p>

    <p>The CSV file named <code>pupils.csv</code> contains data about
    100&nbsp;students. Unfortunately, the data is not sorted. As a team,
    write a program that reads the contents of <code>pupils.csv</code>
    into a compound list, sorts the list by birthday from oldest to
    youngest, and then prints the list with the data about each student
    on a separate line.</p>

        prints each element of the list on a separate line. In other
        words, this <code>print_list</code> function should include a
        <code>for</code> loop that prints each element on a separate
        line.</div></li>

        <li><div>Near the top of <code>pupils.py</code>, below the three
        indexes, write the <code>main</code> function. Inside the
        <code>main</code> function, write statements to do the following:
        <ol>
            <li><div>Call the <code>read_compound_list</code> function
            to read the <code>pupils.csv</code> file into a list named
            <var>students_list</var>.</div></li>
            <li><div>Write a lambda function that will extract the
            birthdate from a student.</div></li>
            <li><div>Write a call to the Python built-in
            <code>sorted</code> function that will sort the
            <var>students_list</var> by birthdate from oldest to
            youngest.</div></li>
            <li><div>Print the <var>students_list</var> by calling the
            <code>print_list</code> function.</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>

        <li><div>At the bottom of the <code>pupils.py</code> file write
        a call to the <code>main</code> function.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="l11_teach_required">Core Requirements</h3>
    <p>Your program must contain the following:</p>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>A function named <code>print_list</code> that takes a
        list as a parameter and prints the list with each element of the
        list on a separate line.</div></li>
        <li><div>A function named <code>main</code> that calls
        <code>read_compound_list</code> and
        <code>print_list</code>.</div></li>
        <li><div>Statements in the <code>main</code> function that sort
        the <var>students_list</var> by birthdate from oldest to
        youngest.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="l11_teach_stretch">Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an
    hour, complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that
    the stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Within the <code>main</code> function, replace the code
        that sorts the <var>students_list</var> by birthdate, with code
        that sorts the <var>students_list</var> by given name.</div></li>

        <li><div>Within the <code>main</code> function, replace the code
        that sorts the <var>students_list</var> by birthdate, with code
        that sorts the <var>students_list</var> by birth month and day.
        In other words, the code should sort the
        <var>students_list</var> by birthdate but ignore the year when a
        student was born.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="l11_teach_testing">Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="test long">
        <li><div>Run your program and ensure that your program's output
        is sorted correctly as shown below.

    <h1>11 Prove Milestone: Student Chosen Program</h1>

    <h2 id="l11_prove_purpose">Purpose</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a significant Python program that solves
    a real-world problem and is well organized with functions.</p>

    <h2 id="l11_prove_assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>During this lesson and the next two lessons, write a Python
    program that you choose. Your program must include multiple
    functions that each perform a single task. You must write test
    functions for at least two of your program functions and run your
    test functions with <code>pytest</code>.</p>

    <p>Ideally your program will solve a real-world problem or become a
    tool in a subject area that interests you, such as chemistry,
    physics, geography, fashion, family history, linguistics, social
    work, food science, carpentry, machinery, engineering, mathematics,
    computing, etc. Before you begin writing your program, you must
    <strong>propose your program to your instructor</strong> to ensure
    that the program is neither too easy nor too difficult for the time
    remaining in this course. If you finish your program more quickly
    than you or your instructor expected, and there is time remaining in
    this course, then choose and write another program.</p>

    <h2 id="l11_prove_propse">Proposal</h2>
    <p>To write a proposal for your program, download and save this
    <a download href="proposal.txt">proposal.txt</a> file. Open the
    downloaded file in VS Code. Answer each of the questions and save
    your file.</p>

    <h2 id="l11_prove_possible">Possible Programs</h2>
    <p>If you find it difficult to choose a program to write, you may
    choose to write one of the following programs:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>A program that performs calculations that are useful in
        your major or hobby.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program with a complete graphical user interface
        (GUI), including windows, frames, labels, text fields, and
        buttons. Use either the <code>tkinter</code> or <code>kivy</code>
        module. The team assignment in the next lesson will show you how
        to write code for a simple GUI.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that reads a text file and counts how often
        each word occurs in the file.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that reads English text from a file and
        converts strangely spelled words to a simpler spelling that more
        closely matches their pronunciation. Consider just a few of the
        strangely spelled English words: comb, lamb, have, done, two,
        Wednesday, should, night ("ight" is a blight on the English
        language). For more information, see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language_spelling_reform">English-language
        spelling reform</a> article at Wikipedia.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program to reorganize or rename all the files in a
        collection of files, such as collection of Microsoft Word
        documents, Excel spreadsheets, music (mp3) files, pictures (jpg)
        files. If you choose to write this program, we
        <strong>strongly</strong> suggest that you make a copy of the
        files that your program will reorganize or rename and run your
        program on the copy. This is because it is highly likely that
        you will make mistakes when writing this program, and such
        mistakes may cause the files to be deleted. Really.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that graphically simulates the spread of a
        disease like the simulations in this <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/">Washington
        Post article</a>. Your program should include variables that can
        be changed, such as movement rate, probability of transmission,
        length of contagiousness, length of illness, and probability of
        death.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that retrieves data from a a server on the
        internet. The Python
        <a href="https://docs.python-requests.org"><code>requests</code></a>
        module contains functions that retrieve data from a
        server.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that uses the
        <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org"><code>pandas</code></a>
        module to process a data set and produces charts that help
        people visualize information about the data set.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that retrieves data from a relational
        database. The MySQL Python connector is a Python module that
        enables Python programs to read from and write to a MySQL
        relational database. It was written by the same developers who
        wrote the MySQL server. You can download it from the
        <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/">MySQL downloads
        page</a> and install it on your Windows, Mac OS, or Linux
        computer.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that retrieves data from a Firebase
        database.</div></li>
    </ol>

    </ul>

    <p>If you don't understand the description of one of these possible
    projects, ask your CSE 111 team members or your instructor to
    explain the project to you.</p>

    <h2 id="l11_prove_organize">Organization</h2>
    <p>As you develop your program, be certain to divide the program
    into functions. Each function should perform a single task and be
    appropriately named. Remember that the most reusable and easily
    testable functions don't get user input and don't print results but
    instead have parameters and return a result. Functions that get user
    input and print results are important and do useful work but are not
    easily reusable and testable. It's fine if some of the functions in
    your program have no parameters, return nothing, get user input,
    and print results, but it's bad if all of your program functions are
    like that.</p>

    <h2 id="l11_prove_testing">Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>You should follow good coding practices by writing test functions
    for many of your program functions. Run your test functions with
    <code>pytest</code> to verify that your program functions work
    correctly. Many students believe that the program functions they
    write cannot be tested with test functions and <code>pytest</code>.
    Such claims are simply false. Here are just some of the reasons that
    students have claimed make their program functions untestable and
    example code that shows such claims are false.</p>

    <h3>My function can't be tested because it:</h3>
    <ul class="long">
        <li><div>Calculates numbers
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
def payment(amt, ar, y, ppy):
    """Computes and returns the payment amount
    for a loan with a fixed annual interest rate.
    """
    r = ar / ppy
    n = y * ppy
    p = amt * r / (1 - (1 + r) ** -n)
    return round(p, 2)</pre></div>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">

    assert payment(80_000, 0.04, 15, 4) == 1779.56</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Processes text instead of numbers

<pre class="text">CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?

3. What will you learn from developing this program?

4. What Python modules will your program use?

    (Some examples are: csv, datetime, functools, matplotlib, math,
    pandas, pytest, random, requests, and tkinter.)

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?

    (Remember that the most reusable functions don't get user input and
    don't print results but instead have parameters and return a result
    Functions that get user input and print results are important and d
    useful work but are not easily reusable.)

    (Remember also that it's hard to test functions that get user input
    and print results. It's easy to test functions that don't get user
    input and don't print results but instead have parameters and retur
    a result. Therefore, you should write most of your program function
    to have parameters and return a result.)

6. Will you write test functions to test at least two of your program
functions?

    <h1>12 Prepare: Using Objects</h1>
    <p>A <dfn>paradigm</dfn> is a way of thinking or a way of perceiving
    the world. There are at least four main paradigms for programming a
    computer: procedural, declarative, functional, and object-oriented.
    During most of CSE&nbsp;110 and&nbsp;111, you used procedural
    programming. During the previous lesson, you encountered functional
    programming. During this lesson, you will be introduced to
    object-oriented programming.</p>

    <h2 id="l12_prepare_pardigms">Programming Paradigms</h2>
    <h3 id="l12_prepare_procedural">Procedural Programming</h3>
    <p>Procedural programming is a way of programming that focuses on
    the process or the steps to accomplish a task. For example, if we
    had 100 numbers and wanted to know the average value of those 100
    numbers, we could add the numbers and then divide by 100. This is
    one process to compute the average of numbers: add them and divide
    by the quantity of numbers. A Python procedural program for
    computing the average is shown in example&nbsp;1.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l12_prepare_ex1"><pre class="python"># Example 1

def main():
    numbers = [87, 95, 72, 92, 95, 88, 84]
    total = 0
    for x in numbers:
        total += x
    average = total / len(numbers)
    print(f"average: {average:.2f}")


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="l12_prepare_ex1">&gt; python example_1.py
average: 87.57</pre>

    <p>Notice that with procedural programming, we must write the
    process or the steps that are necessary to complete a task.
    Procedural programming is the type of programming that you did most
    often in CSE&nbsp;110 and&nbsp;111.</p>

    <h3 id="l12_prepare_declarative">Declarative Programming</h3>
    <p>When we use declarative programming to program a computer, we do
    not focus on the process or steps to accomplish a task, but rather
    we focus on what we want from the task, or in other words, we focus
    on the desired result. Continuing the example of the average, with
    declarative programming, we focus on exactly what numbers we want
    averaged and tell the computer to compute that average for us. SQL
    is a declarative programming language used with relational
    databases. Example&nbsp;2 contains SQL code that causes the computer
    to compute the average of a column of numbers.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l12_prepare_ex2"><pre class="python">-- Example 2

SELECT AVG(numbers) FROM table;</pre></div>

    <p>Notice in example&nbsp;2, that the code does not contain the
    steps required to compute the average. Someone else already wrote
    the code that contains those steps. Instead, the SQL code contains a
    command that tells the computer to compute the average of a column
    named <var>numbers</var>. The term "declarative programming" means
    that we write or declare what we want the computer to do. We do not
    tell the computer how to compute something. We declare what we want
    the computer to do, and the computer determines how to do it and
    then does it.</p>

    <h3 id="l12_prepare_functional">Functional Programming</h3>
    <p>When we use functional programming to program a computer, we
    focus on the functions necessary to accomplish a task.
    Mathematicians often find functional programming natural for them
    because they are accustomed to using functions while studying
    mathematics. In functional programming, functions are so important
    that we often pass functions into other functions. You did this in
    the checkpoint and team activity for lesson&nbsp;11. Example&nbsp;3
    contains a functional programming solution to computing the average
    in Python.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l12_prepare_ex3"><pre class="python"># Example 3

from functools import reduce

def main():
    numbers = [87, 95, 72, 92, 95, 88, 84]
    func_add = lambda a, b: a + b
    total = <em>reduce(func_add, numbers)</em>
    average =  total / len(numbers)
    print(f"average: {average:.2f}")


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="l12_prepare_ex3">&gt; python example_3.py
average: 87.57</pre>

    <p>Notice how example&nbsp;3 uses three functions: a lambda
    function, the <code>reduce</code> function, and the <code>len</code>
    function. Notice also that the lambda function is passed into the
    <code>reduce</code> function. Passing a function into a function is
    one of the marks of functional programming.</p>

    <h3 id="l12_prepare_object_oriented">Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
    <p>Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on
    the concept of objects. An <dfn>object</dfn> is a piece of a program
    that contains both data (also known as attributes) and functions
    (also known as methods).</p>

    <p>When we write an object-oriented program, we combine data and
    functions together into objects. For example, if we were writing a
    registration program used by students to register for courses at a
    university, we would write code to create <code>Student</code>
    objects and <code>Course</code> objects. Each <code>Student</code>
    object would have data such as <var>given_name</var>,
    <var>family_name</var>, and <var>phone_number</var> and would have
    functions such as <code>register</code>, <code>enroll</code>,
    <code>drop</code>, and <code>withdraw</code>. Each
    <code>Course</code> object would have data such as
    <var>course_code</var>, <var>title</var>, <var>description</var>,
    and <var>list_of_students</var> and would have functions such as
    <code>get_students</code> and <code>take_role</code>.</p>

    <p>Python includes many built-in and standard objects that a
    programmer can use to write programs. In fact, you have already used
    many objects in your programs. Python lists and dictionaries are
    objects and have attributes and methods. Readers and Writers from
    the <code>csv</code> module are also objects.</p>

    <p>One of the marks of object-oriented programming is selecting
    attributes and calling methods using the <dfn>dot operator</dfn> (a
    period). The official name of the dot operator is <dfn>component
    selector</dfn>, but almost no one calls it that because the term
    "dot" is much easier to say than "component selector." The code in
    example&nbsp;4 uses the dot operator (.) to call the
    <code>append</code> method.</p>

    <p>There are several types of commands that are commonly found in
    object-oriented programs. These types of commands are so common,
    that a programmer must be able to recognize and write them. Three of
    these types of commands are:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Creating objects, for example:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">obj = datetime.now()</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Accessing the attributes of an object using the dot
        operator (.), for example:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">year = obj.year</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Calling the methods of an object using the dot
        operator (.), for example:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">new_obj = obj.replace(year=2035)
day_of_week = obj.weekday()</pre></div>
        </div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="l12_prepare_lists_are_objs">Python Lists Are Objects</h2>
    <p>In Python, lists are objects with attributes and methods, and a
    programmer can modify a list by calling those methods. The list
    methods are documented in a section of the Python Tutorial titled
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists">More on Lists</a>.</p>

    <p>Example&nbsp;5 contains a program that is similar to
    <a href="../lesson07/prepare.html#ex2">example&nbsp;2</a> in the
    prepare content of lesson&nbsp;7. Now that you know what an object
    is, that objects have methods, and that Python lists are objects,
    this example code should make more sense than it did in
    lesson&nbsp;7. Notice that the <code>append</code> method is called on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l12_prepare_ex5">lines&nbsp;8&ndash;10</span>,
    <code>insert</code> is called on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l12_prepare_ex5">line&nbsp;13</span>,
    <code>index</code> is called on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l12_prepare_ex5">line&nbsp;17</span>,
    <code>pop</code> is called on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l12_prepare_ex5">line&nbsp;24</span>, and
    <code>remove</code> is called on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="l12_prepare_ex5">line&nbsp;27</span>.</p>

<div class="pre" id="l12_prepare_ex5"><pre class="linenums"></pre>

def main():
    # Create an empty list that will hold fabric names.
    fabrics = []

    # Add three elements at the end of the fabrics list.
    fabrics.append("velvet")
    fabrics.append("denim")
    fabrics.append("gingham")

    # Insert an element at the beginning of the fabrics list.
    fabrics.insert(0, "chiffon")

    <h2 id="l12_prepare_dicts_are_objs">Python Dictionaries Are Objects</h2>
    <p>Python dictionaries are objects with attributes and methods, and
    a programmer can modify a dictionary by calling those methods. There
    doesn't seem to be an official Python web page that documents the
    dictionary methods, so here is a list of the built-in dictionary
    methods:</p>

    <table><thead>
        <tr><th>Method</th> <th>Description</th></tr>
    </thead><tbody>
        <tr><td>d.clear()</td>
            <td>Removes all the elements from the dictionary
            <var>d</var>.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>d.copy()</td>
            <td>Returns a copy of the dictionary <var>d</var>.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>d.get(<var>key</var>)</td>
            <td>Returns the value of the specified <code>key</code>.
            Calling the get method is almost equivalent to using square
            brackets ([&nbsp;and&nbsp;]) to find a key in a
            dictionary.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>d.items()</td>
            <td>Returns a list that contains the key value pairs that
            are in the dictionary <var>d</var>.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>d.keys()</td>
            <td>Returns a list that contains the keys that are in the
            dictionary <var>d</var>.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>d.pop(<var>key</var>)</td>
            <td>Removes the element with the specified <var>key</var>
            from the dictionary <var>d</var>.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>d.update(<var>other</var>)</td>
            <td>Updates the dictionary <var>d</var> with the key value
            pairs that are in the <var>other</var> dictionary.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>d.values()</td>

    <h2 id="l12_prepare_summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>This lesson introduces you to object-oriented programming. You
    are learning that an object has data (attributes) and functions
    (methods) and that a programmer uses the dot operator (.) to access
    the attributes and call the methods in an object. Python lists and
    dictionaries are objects and contain attributes and methods.</p>

    <h2 id="l12_check_problem">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>There are several types of commands that are commonly found in
    object oriented programs. These types of commands are so common,
    that a programmer must be able to recognize and write them. One of
    these types of commands is calling the methods of an object using
    the dot operator (.) as shown in this template:</p>

    <h2 id="l12_check_assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>Write a small Python program named <code>fruit.py</code> that
    demonstrates object oriented programming by modifying a list. Do the
    following:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Open a new blank file in VS Code and save it as
        <code>fruit.py</code></div></li>

        <li><div>Copy and paste this code at the top of your
        <code>fruit</code> program:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">def main():

        <li><div>Add code to append "orange" to the end of
        <var>fruit_list</var> and print the list.</div></li>

        <li><div>Add code to find where "apple" is located in
        <var>fruit_list</var> and insert "cherry" before "apple" in the

    <ol class="test">
        <li><div>Run your program and ensure that your program's output
        is the same as the output shown below.

        </div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="l12_check_ponder">Ponder</h2>
    <p>After you finish your program, examine the code in
    <code>main</code> and realize that you wrote object oriented code
    when you used the <code>fruit_list</code> and the dot operator (.)
    to call the <code>reverse</code>, <code>append</code>,
    <code>insert</code>, <code>remove</code>, <code>pop</code>,
    <code>sort</code>, and <code>clear</code> methods.</p>

    <h2 id="l12_check_solution">Sample Solution</h2>

    compare your solution to that one. Before looking at the sample
    solution, you should work to complete this checkpoint program.
    However, if you have worked on it for at least an hour and are still
    having problems, feel free to use the sample solution to help you

    <h1>12 Team Activity: Using Objects</h1>

    <h2 id="l12_teach_instrucs">Instructions</h2>
    <p>Work as a team as explained in the instructions for the
    <a href="../lesson02/teach.html#instrucs">lesson&nbsp;2 team
    activity</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="l12_teach_problem">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Almost all of the programs that you wrote for this course receive
    input from and print results to a terminal window. However, most
    users prefer to interact with a program through a graphical user
    interface (GUI) that contains icons, text fields, drop-down lists,
    buttons, etc. Within a GUI, the individual components (icons, text
    fields, etc.) are called widgets. Most libraries for creating GUIs
    use object oriented programming because each widget is an object
    with attributes and methods.</p>

    <h2 id="l12_teach_assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>As a team, write a Python program named <code>gui.py</code> that
    gets user input from a GUI, performs a simple calculation, and
    displays the result in a GUI.</p>

    <h2 id="l12_teach_helpful_docs">Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <ul class="tutorials">
        <li><div>GUI <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_gui_programming.htm">Programming with Tkinter</a></div></li>

        <li><div>Official documentation for the
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html">tkinter module</a></div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="l12_teach_steps">Steps</h2>
    <p>Do the following:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Download these two Python files:
        <a download href="heart_rate.py">heart_rate.py</a> and
        <a download href="number_entry.py">number_entry.py</a>
        and save them in the same folder where you will save your Python
        program.</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the <code>heart_rate.py</code> file in VS Code and
        run it. Notice how running the program opens a GUI where a user
        can enter his age and see heart rates for exercising. Experiment
        with the GUI by entering different ages, seeing the results, and
        clicking the "Clear" button.</div></li>

        <li><div>Read the comments and examine the code in the
        <code>heart_rate.py</code> program. Notice the following:
        <ol>
            <li><div>To create its GUI, the heart_rate program uses the
            <code>tkinter</code> module which is imported at
            line&nbsp;3.</div></li>

            <li><div>The <code>main</code> function begins at
            line&nbsp;7.</div></li>

            <li><div>The <code>main</code> function creates a
            <code>tk.TK</code> root object and uses that object to
            create the main window for the program.</div></li>

            <li><div>Beginning at line&nbsp;49, the
            <code>populate_main_window</code> function creates labels,
            text entry boxes, and buttons and places them in a
            grid.</div></li>

            <li><div>Inside the <code>populate_main_window</code>
            function, there are two nested functions named
            <code>calculate</code> and <code>clear</code>. The
            <code>calculate</code> function is called each time the user
            enters a digit in the age text field. The <code>clear</code>
            function is called each time the user clicks the "Clear"
            button.</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>

        <li><div>Choose a simple calculation or formula for your program
        to calculate. You could choose one of these:

        <ol>
            <li><div>Area of a circle:
<div class="inline formula"><var>a</var> = &pi;&thinsp;<var>r</var><sup>2</sup></div>
            </div></li>

            <li><div>Swing time of a pendulum:
<div class="inline formula"><var>t</var> = 2&pi; <div class="radic two"><div>&radic;</div><div class="fract"><div><var>n</var></div><div>9.81</div></div></div></div>
            </div></li>

            <li><div>Area of a rectangle:
<div class="inline formula"><var>a</var> = <var>w</var><var>h</var></div>
            </div></li>

            <li><div>Volume of a tire:
<div class="inline formula"><var>v</var> = <div class="fract"><div>&pi;&thinsp;<var>w</var><sup>2</sup>&thinsp;<var>a</var><span class="paren"><var>w</var>&thinsp;<var>a</var> + 2,540&thinsp;<var>d</var></span></div><div>10,000,000,000</div></div></div>
            </div></li>
        </ol></div></li>

        <li><div>Use the <code>heart_rate.py</code> program as a
        reference (you could even copy and paste parts of it or all of
        it) and write a Python program with a GUI that calculates the
        formula that you chose.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="l12_teach_required">Core Requirements</h3>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Your program must include a GUI that opens when you run
        your program.</div></li>

        <li><div>The GUI must allow a user to enter input.</div></li>

        <li><div>When the user enters valid input, your program must
        compute correct results and display those results in the
        GUI.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="l12_teach_stretch">Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an hour,
    complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that the
    stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Add a "Clear" button to your GUI that clears all inputs
        and outputs when the user clicks it.</div></li>

        <li><div>Add a label that acts as a status bar at the bottom of
        your GUI. Your program should display an error message in the
        status bar when the user enters invalid input. Your program
        should clear the status bar when the user enters valid
        input.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="l12_teach_testing">Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Run your program and enter various inputs, including invalid
    values. Verify that your program doesn't crash, behaves as expected,
    and displays correct results.</p>

    <h2 id="l12_teach_ponder">Ponder</h2>
    <p>After you finish your program, examine the code in the
    <code>populate_main_window</code> function and realize that you
    wrote object oriented code when you used objects such as
    <var>lbl_age</var>, <var>lbl_width</var>, <var>txt_age</var>, and
    <var>txt_width</var> and the dot operator to call methods such as
    <code>grid</code>, <code>config</code>, <code>get</code>, and
    <code>clear</code>.</p>

    <h2 id="l12_teach_solution">Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your solution to the
    <a class="solution" href="teach_solution.py">sample solution</a>.
    Please <strong>do not look at the sample solution</strong> until you
    have either finished the program or diligently worked for at least

        lesson?</div></li>

        <li><div>Description&mdash;10%: Is the description of your work
        for this lesson complete and easily understandable? Your
        description should include the following:
        <ol>
            <li><div>A list of the function names in your
            program.</div></li>
            <li><div>A list of the test function names in your test
            code.</div></li>
            <li><div>A list of the documentation that you read, the
            videos that you watched, and the coding experiments that you
            tried.</div></li>
            <li><div>A description or list of the work that you finished
            on your program.</div></li>
        </ol>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Python program file&mdash;25%: Upload your Python
        program. Your teacher will evaluate it according to these
        criteria:
        <ol>
            <li><div>Your program is divided into functions and each
            function performs one task only.</div></li>
            <li><div>Your program effectively uses existing Python
            modules such as math, random, requests, pandas, and
            tkinter.</div></li>
            <li><div>Your program performs a significant real world
            task.</div></li>
        </ol>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Python test file&mdash;15%: Upload your Python test
        file. Your teacher will evaluate it according to these criteria:
        <ol>
            <li><div>Each testable program function is covered (tested)
            by one test function. (Some functions, especially main and
            those that create GUIs are difficult to test and don't need
            to have a corresponding test function.)</div></li>
            <li><div>Each test function completely exercises (tests) its
            corresponding program function. In other words, the test
            function calls the program function multiple times with
            different arguments, including unusual or unexpected
            values.</div></li>

    <h1>14 Prepare: Conclusion</h1>
    <p><strong>Congratulations!</strong> <em>You successfully made it to
    the final lesson of CSE&nbsp;111.</em></p>

    <p>During this course you learned to write programs organized with
    functions to solve significant problems in a variety of domains,
    which was the major outcome of this course. In addition, you learned
    to do the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><div>Research modules, objects, and functions written by
        others and use them in your programs.</div></li>
        <li><div>Write programs that can detect and recover from invalid
        conditions (exceptions).</div></li>
        <li><div>Follow good practices in designing, writing, and
        debugging functions, including writing each function so that it
        performs one task only and writing test functions to verify that
        program functions are correct.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each of these skills will transfer to other programming languages
    that you learn in your future. Also, researching modules, objects,
    and functions written by others gave you important practice in
    lifelong learning. Even though the work of this course may have been
    challenging at times, you showed skill in thinking analytically,
    breaking down problems into manageable pieces, working with others,
    and debugging abstract problems. These are skills that will transfer
    to any field of study or career path that you choose.</p>

    <p>The final two tasks in CSE&nbsp;111 are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Write a personal reflection document.</div></li>
        <li><div>Complete a one question survey.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Both of these two final tasks are in I-Learn. Please find them in
    the Lesson&nbsp;14 module and complete both of them. May you never
    confuse Python tuples (,), lists [], sets {}, and dictionaries {:},
    and in all seriousness, may the Lord bless all your righteous
    endeavors.</p>
