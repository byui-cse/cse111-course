	<h1>05 Team Activity: Fitness Functions</h1>

	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>Arrange a one-hour synchronous meeting with your team for this
	activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing meeting.
	Campus students will use class time for this meeting. You should
	prepare for this meeting by completing the preparation material and
	the individual checkpoint assignment beforehand.</p>

	<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
	<p>Health professionals who are helping a client achieve a healthy
	body weight, sometimes use two computed values called body mass
	index and basal metabolic rate.</p>

	<p>From the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention we read,
	"Body mass index (BMI) is a person's weight in kilograms divided by
	the square of their height in meters. BMI can be used to screen for
	weight categories such as underweight, normal, overweight, and
	obese, that may lead to health problems. However, BMI is not
	diagnostic of the body fatness or health of an individual." The
	formula for computing BMI is</p>
	<div class="blockExpr">bmi = <div>10000&#x202f;weight<hr>height<sup>2</sup></div></div>
	<p>where <var>weight</var> is in kilograms and <var>height</var> is
	in centimeters.</p>

	<p>Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the minimum number of calories
	required to keep your body functioning at rest. BMR is different for
	women and men and changes with age. The revised Harris-Benedict
	formulas for computing BMR are</p>
	<div class="blockExpr">(women) bmr = 447.593 + 9.247&#x202f;weight + 3.098&#x202f;height - 4.330&#x202f;age</div>
	<div class="blockExpr">(men) bmr = 88.362 + 13.397&#x202f;weight + 4.799&#x202f;height - 5.677&#x202f;age</div>
	<p>where <var>weight</var> is in kilograms and <var>height</var> is
	in centimeters.</p>

	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<p>Download this file: <a target="_blank" download
	href="fitness.csv">fitness.csv</a> and save it in the same folder
	where you will save your Python program. Open the file in VS Code
	and notice that it contains four columns: gender, birthdate, weight
	(in U.S. pounds), and height (in U.S. inches).</p>

	<p>Write a Python program that reads the contents of the
	<code>fitness.csv</code> file, converts weight from pounds to
	kilograms, converts inches to centimeters, and calculates age, BMI,
	and BMR.</p>

	<p>Do the following:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><div>Start your program by copying and pasting this code
		into your program at the top of your Python file.
<pre class="python">import csv
from datetime import date, datetime
import math

def compute_age(birth):
    """Compute and return a person's age in years.

    param birth: a person's birthdate stored as
        a string in this format: YYYY-MM-DD
    """
    birthdate = datetime.strptime(birth, "%Y-%m-%d").date()
    now = date.today()
    diff = now - birthdate
    years = math.floor(diff.days / 365.25)
    return years</pre></div></li>

		<li><div>Write a function named <code>kg_from_lb</code> that
		takes one parameter named <var>lb</var> and converts the value
		in the parameter to kilograms and returns the kilogram

		<li><div>Write a function named <code>cm_from_in</code> that
		takes one parameter named <var>inch</var> and converts the value
		in the parameter from inches to centimeters and returns the
		centimeter value.</div></li>

		<li><div>Write a function named <code>body_mass_index</code>
		that takes two parameters named <var>weight</var> and
		<var>height</var>. This function must compute and return a
		person's body mass index. Use the formula for BMI given in the
		Problem Statement section of this document.</div></li>

		<li><div>Write a function named <code>basal_metabolic_rate</code>
		that takes four parameters named <var>gender</var>,
		<var>weight</var>, <var>height</var>, and <var>age</var>. This
		function must compute and return a person's basal metabolic
		rate. Use the formulas for BMR given in the Problem Statement
		section of this document.</div></li>

		<li><div>Write a function named <code>main</code> that takes no
		parameters and does the following:
		<ol>
			<li><div>Prints this header: "Gender, Age (years), Weight
			(kg), Height (cm), BMI, BMR"</div></li>
			<li><div>Opens the <code>fitness.csv</code> file for
			reading</div></li>
			<li><div>Uses the <code>csv</code> module to get a reader
			object</div></li>
			<li><div>Processes each row in the csv file by calling the
			<code>compute_age</code>, <code>kg_from_lb</code>,
			<code>cm_from_in</code>, <code>body_mass_index</code>, and
			<code>basal_metabolic_rate</code> functions.</div></li>
			<li><div></div></li>
		</ol></div></li>

	<h2>Sample Run</h2>
<pre class="console">&gt; python teach_solution.py
Gender, Age (years), Weight (kg), Height (cm), BMI, BMR
F, 30, 58.97, 157.5, 23.8, 1350.9
F, 35, 61.23, 163.8, 22.8, 1369.7
F, 39, 56.7, 161.3, 21.8, 1302.7
M, 28, 63.5, 182.9, 19.0, 1657.9
M, 35, 65.77, 176.5, 21.1, 1617.8
M, 38, 70.31, 174.0, 23.2, 1649.6</pre>

	<p>Note that the output of your program will not be the same for the
	Age and BMR columns because you will run your program after this
	assignment was written.</p>

	<h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
	<p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
	in this testing procedure:</p>
	<ol class="testing">
		<li><div></div></li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Sample Solution</h2>
	<p>Please work diligently with your team for the one-hour meeting.
	After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
	sample solution. Please <strong>do not look at the sample
	solution</strong> until you have either finished the program or
	diligently worked for at least one hour. At the end of the hour, if
	you are still struggling to complete the assignment, you may use the
	sample solution to help you finish.</p>

	<ul class="links">
		<li>Sample solution:
		<a target="_blank" download
		href="./teach_solution.py">teach_solution.py</a></li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Submission</h2>
	<p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
	via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
	requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
	during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
	with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
	on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
	completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
