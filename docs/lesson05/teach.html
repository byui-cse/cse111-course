    <h1>05 Team Activity: Writing Functions</h1>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Arrange a one hour synchronous meeting with your team for this
    activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing meeting.
    Campus students will use class time for this meeting. You should
    prepare for this meeting by completing the preparation material and
    the individual checkpoint assignment beforehand.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Health professionals who are helping a client achieve a healthy
    body weight, sometimes use two computed values called body mass
    index and basal metabolic rate.</p>

    <p>From the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention we read,
    "Body mass index (BMI) is a person's weight in kilograms divided by
    the square of their height in meters. BMI can be used to screen for
    weight categories such as underweight, normal, overweight, and obese
    that may lead to health problems. However, BMI is not diagnostic of
    the body fatness or health of an individual." The formula for
    computing BMI is</p>
    <div class="block expr"><var>bmi</var> = <div class="fract"><div class="numer">10,000 <var>weight</var></div><div class="denom"><var>height</var><sup>2</sup></div></div></div>
    <p>where <var>weight</var> is in kilograms and <var>height</var> is
    in centimeters.</p>

    <p>Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the minimum number of calories
    required to keep your body functioning at rest. BMR is different for
    women and men and changes with age. The revised Harris-Benedict
    formulas for computing BMR are</p>
    <div class="block expr">(women) &nbsp;<var>bmr</var> = 447.593 + 9.247 <var>weight</var> + 3.098 <var>height</var> &minus; 4.330 <var>age</var></div>
    <div class="block expr">(men) &nbsp;<var>bmr</var> = 88.362 + 13.397 <var>weight</var> + 4.799 <var>height</var> &minus; 5.677 <var>age</var></div>
    <p>where <var>weight</var> is in kilograms and <var>height</var> is
    in centimeters.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><div>The prepare content for lesson&nbsp;3 includes a
        section about <a target="_blank"
        href="../lesson03/prepare.html#csvFiles">reading CSV
        files</a>.</div></li>

        <li><div>The prepare content for this lesson explains how to
        <a target="_blank" href="prepare.html">write functions</a>.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Download the <a download href="fitness.csv">fitness.csv</a> file
    and save it in the same folder where you will save your Python
    program. Open the file in VS Code and notice that it contains four
    columns: gender, birthdate, weight (in U.S. pounds), and height (in
    U.S. inches).</p>

    <p>Write a Python program named <code>fitness.py</code> that does
    the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Reads the contents of the <code>fitness.csv</code>
        file.</div></li>
        <li><div>Converts weight from pounds to kilograms (1 lb =
        0.45359237 kg).</div></li>
        <li><div>Converts inches to centimeters (1 in = 2.54 cm).</div></li>
        <li><div>Calculates age, BMI, and BMR.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Use the following design to write your program. Write code for
    each function that contains the keyword <code>pass</code>. Then
    delete the keyword <code>pass</code>.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python"># Import necessary modules.
import csv
import math
from datetime import date, datetime


def main():
    # Print this header:
    # Gender,Age (years),Weight (kg),Height (cm),BMI,BMR

    # Open the fitness.csv file for reading.

        # Use the csv module to get a reader object.

        # Process each row in the csv file by doing the following:
            # 1. Call the compute_age, kg_from_lb, cm_from_in,
            #    body_mass_index, and basal_metabolic_rate
            #    functions as necessary.
            # 2. Print the gender, age in years, weight in
            #    kilograms, height in centimeters, body mass
            #    index, and basal metabolic rate.
    pass


def compute_age(birth):
    """Compute and return a person's age in years.

    param birth: a person's birthdate stored as
        a string in this format: YYYY-MM-DD
    """
    birthdate = datetime.strptime(birth, "%Y-%m-%d").date()
    now = date.today()
    diff = now - birthdate
    years = math.floor(diff.days / 365.25)
    return years


def kg_from_lb(lb):
    """Convert a mass in US pounds to kilograms.
    param lb: a mass in US pounds
    """
    pass


def cm_from_in(inch):
    """Convert a length in inches to centimeters.
    param inch: a length in inches
    """
    pass


def body_mass_index(weight, height):
    """Calculate and return a person's body mass
    index (bmi). weight and height must be in
    kilograms and centimeters, respectively.
    """
    pass


def basal_metabolic_rate(gender, weight, height, age):
    """Calculate and return a person's basal metabolic
    rate (bmr). weight must be in kilograms, height
    must be in centimeters, and age must be in years.
    """
    pass

# this program will start executing.

    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Your program contains five complete and correct
        functions named <code>compute_age</code>,
        <code>kg_from_lb</code>, <code>cm_from_in</code>,
        <code>body_mass_index</code>, and
        <code>basal_metabolic_rate</code>. To be correct, the
        <code>basal_metabolic_rate</code> function must compute BMR
        differently for males and females.</div></li>

        <li><div>Your program includes a function named
        <code>main</code> which prints the header, opens the
        <code>fitness.csv</code> file, and reads each row in the
        file.</div></li>

        <li><div>The <code>main</code> function computes and prints the
        correct values for each row in the <code>fitness.csv</code> file
        by calling the <code>compute_age</code>, <code>float</code>,
        <code>round</code>, <code>kg_from_lb</code>,
        <code>cm_from_in</code>, <code>body_mass_index</code>,
        <code>basal_metabolic_rate</code>, and <code>print</code>
        functions.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an hour,
    complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that the
    stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Add something or change something in your program that
        you think would make your program better, easier for the user,
        more elegant, or more fun. Be creative.</div></li>

        <li><div>Write comments above the lines of code in
        <code>main</code> that were difficult for you to
        understand.</div></li>

        <li><div>Modify your program to print the height values in
        meters instead of centimeters.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Run</h2>
<pre class="console">&gt; python teach_solution.py
Gender,Age (years),Weight (kg),Height (cm),BMI,BMR
F,30,58.97,157.5,23.8,1350.9
F,35,61.23,163.8,22.8,1369.7
F,39,56.7,161.3,21.8,1302.7
M,28,63.5,182.9,19.0,1657.9
M,35,65.77,176.5,21.1,1617.8
M,38,70.31,174.0,23.2,1649.6</pre>

    <p>Note that the output of your program will not be the same for the
    Age and BMR columns because a computer printed the sample run before
    you executed your program. Therefore, when you run your program, the
    people will be older than they were when the computer printed the
    sample run.</p>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="testing">
        <li><div>Run your program and verify that it prints the correct
        results, rounded and formatted as shown in the sample run
        above.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
    <a download href="teach_solution.py">sample solution</a>. Please
    <strong>do not look at the sample solution</strong> until you have
    either finished the program or diligently worked for at least one
    hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling to
    complete the assignment, you may use the sample solution to help you
    finish.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
