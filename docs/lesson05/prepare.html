    <h1>05 Prepare: Writing Functions</h1>
    <p>Because most useful computer programs are very large, programmers
    divide their programs into parts. Dividing a program into parts
    makes it easier to write, debug, and understand the program. A
    programmer can divide a Python program into modules, classes, and
    functions. In this unit, you will learn how to write your own
    functions.</p>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn during this lesson:</p>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>A <dfn>function</dfn> is a group of statements
        (computer commands) that together perform one task.</div></li>

        <li><div>A programmer (you) can save lots of time by writing and
        calling your own functions.</div></li>

        <li><div>To write a function in Python, simply type code that
        matches this template:

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">def <var>function_name</var>(<var>param1</var>, <var>param2</var>, &hellip; <var>paramN</var>):
    <var>statement1</var>
    <var>statement2</var>
        &vellip;
    <var>statementN</var>
    return <var>value</var></pre></div></div></li>

        <li><div>The first line of a function is called the
        <dfn>header</dfn> or <dfn>signature</dfn>, and it includes the
        following:
        <ol>
            <li><div>the keyword <code>def</code></div></li>
            <li><div>the function name</div></li>
            <li><div>the parameter list</div></li>
        </ol>
        Here is the header for a function named <code>draw_circle</code>
        that takes three parameters named <code>x</code>,
        <code>y</code>, and <code>radius</code>:

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">def draw_circle(x, y, radius):</pre></div></div></li>

        <li><div>The function name must start with a letter or the
        underscore (_). The rest of the name must be made of letters,
        digits (0â€“9), or the underscore. A function name cannot include
        spaces or other punctuation. A function name should be
        meaningful and should describe curtly what the function
        does.</div></li>

        <li><div>The parameter list contains data stored in variables
        that the function needs to complete its task. A
        <dfn>parameter</dfn> is a variable whose value comes from
        outside the function. One way to get input into a function is to
        ask the user for input by calling the built-in Python
        <code>input</code> function. Another way to get input into a
        function is through the function's parameters. Getting input
        through parameters is much more flexible than asking the user
        for input because the input through parameters can come from the
        user or a file on a hard drive or the network or a sensor or
        even another function.</div></li>

        <li><div><p>The statements inside a function are called the
        <dfn>body</dfn> of the function. A function may contain as many
        statements as you wish to write inside of it. However, it is a
        good idea to limit functions to less than a page (60 lines)
        long. To <dfn>return</dfn> a result from a function so that the
        result can be used somewhere else in your program, simply type
        the keyword <code>return</code> followed by whatever value you
        want returned to the calling function.</p>

        <p>Here is a function (both the header and body) that computes
        and returns the average of three numbers:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">def average(a, b, c):
    """Computes and returns the average of three numbers."""
    total = a + b + c
    avg = total / 3
    return avg</pre></div>

        <p>Here is a function that takes two parameters named
        <var>a</var> and <var>r</var> and computes and returns the value
        of this equation:
&nbsp;<var>f</var>&#x202f;(<var>a</var>,<var>r</var>&#x202f;) = <var>a</var> &times; (1 + <var>r</var>&#x202f;).</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">def formula(a, r):
    """Computes and returns the value of a * (1 + r)"""
    result = a * (1 + r)
    return result</pre></div></div></li>

        <li><div>In all previous Python programs that you wrote in CSE
        110 and 111, you wrote statements that were not in a function
        like this simple program:

<div class="pre"><pre class="python"># Get a value in miles and convert it to kilometers.
miles = float(input("Please enter a distance in miles: "))
km = miles * 1.60934
print(f"{miles} miles is {km} kilometers")</pre></div>

        <p>However, writing statements outside of a function can lead to
        poor organization within a large program. Professional software
        developers write statements inside a function whenever possible.
        Beginning with this lesson, we will write nearly all statements
        inside a function. Also, each program will have a function named
        <code>main</code> which will contain the beginning statements of
        the program. In addition, we will have one or more functions
        that perform calculations and other useful work and return a
        value to the call point. For example:</p>

        <img src="call.png" alt="A diagram showing a call to a function and a value returned from that function">
<!--
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">def main():
    """Get a value in miles, convert it to kilometers,
    and print the miles for the user to see.
    """
    miles = float(input("Please enter a distance in miles: "))
    km = kilometers_from_miles(miles)
    print(f"{miles} miles is {km} kilometers")


def kilometers_from_miles(miles):
    """Convert a value in miles to kilometers
    and return the kilometers value.
    """
    km = miles * 1.60934
    return km


# Start this program by
# calling the main function.
main()</pre></div>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">import math

<b>def main()</b>:
    """Get the length of each side of a triangle,
    call the triangle_area function, and print
    the area for the user to see.
    """
    print("This program computes the area of a triangle.")
    print("Enter the length of each side:")
    side1 = float(input())
    side2 = float(input())
    side3 = float(input())
    <b>triarea = triangle_area(side1, side2, side3)</b>
    print(f"The area is {triarea}")


<b>def triangle_area(a, b, c)</b>:
    """Compute and return the area of a
    triangle with side lengths a, b, and c.
    """
    s = (a + b + c) / 2
    area = math.sqrt(s * (s-a) * (s-b) * (s-c))
    <b>return area</b>


# Start this program by
# calling the main function.
<b>main()</b></pre></div>
-->

        <p>A computer will execute the statements in the previous
        example in this order:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><div>The statement at (1) is not inside of a function,
            so the computer executes it when the program begins. This is
            a call to the <code>main</code> function which causes the
            computer to begin executing the statements inside of
            <code>main</code> at (2).</div></li>
            <li><div>The computer gets three numbers from the
            user.</div></li>
            <li><div>The statement at (3) is a call to the
            <code>triangle_area</code> function.</div></li>
            <li><div>The computer copies the values in the arguments
            <var>side1</var>, <var>side2</var>, and <var>side3</var>
            into the parameters <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, and
            <var>c</var>, respectively and then begins executing the
            statements inside the <code>triangle_area</code> function at
            (5).</div></li>
            <li><div>The computer computes the area of a triangle.</div></li>
            <li><div>The statement at (6) is a return statement which
            causes the computer to stop executing the
            <code>triangle_area</code> function, to return a value to
            the call point at (3), and to resume executing statements at
            (8) after the call point.</div></li>
            <li><div>The computer returns the value in the
            <var>area</var> variable to the call point (3). At the call
            point, the returned value is stored in the
            <var>triarea</var> variable.</div></li>
            <li><div>The computer prints the value that is in the
            <var>triarea</var> variable for the user to see. This is the
            last statement in the <code>main</code> function, so after
            executing it, the computer resumes executing the statements
            after the call point (1) to main.</div></li>
            <li><div>There are no more statements after the call to
            <code>main</code>, so the program is finished.</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>

        <li><div>The most reusable functions are ones that take
        parameters, perform calculations, and return a value but do not
        perform user input and output. In the previous code example,
        there are two functions: <code>main</code> and
        <code>triangle_area</code>. The <code>main</code> function is
        certainly useful in this program, but it is not reusable in
        other programs because it gets user input and prints the result
        for the user to see. The <code>triangle_area</code> function is
        very reusable in another program because it doesn't get user
        input or print output. Instead it takes three parameters,
        performs a calculation, and returns a result to the calling
        function. This second function is so reusable that it could be
        included in a library of functions that compute the area and
        volume of 2-D and 3-D geometric shapes.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>It is extremely important that you can write and call
    functions.</strong> After watching the above videos, if the concepts
    related to writing a function still seem confusing or vague to you,
    read the list of concepts (above the videos) <strong>again</strong>
    and then watch the videos <strong>again</strong>.</p>
