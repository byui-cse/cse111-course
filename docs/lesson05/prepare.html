    <h1>05 Prepare: Writing Functions</h1>

    <p>Throughout your programming experience, you've been using <dfn>functions</dfn>. A function is a group of statements that together perform one task.</p>


    <h2>Types of Functions</h2>
    <p>Broadly speaking, there are four types of functions you'll come across in python:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><p>Built-in functions</p></li>
        <li><p>Standard library functions</p></li>
        <li><p>Third-party functions</p></li>
        <li><p>User defined functions</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Regardless of what kind of functions you're using, they are <dfn>called</dfn> by using their name followed by a set of <code>()</code>'s.</p><p>Note that sometimes people refer to calling a function as <dfn>invoking</dfn> the function or <dfn>executing</dfn> the function.</p>

    <h3>1. Built-in Functions</h3>
    <p>Python includes many <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html">built-in functions</a>. Some examples of built-in functions you've been using include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><p><code>print()</code> - A function that displays output to the user.</p></li>
        <li><p><code>input()</code> - A function that gets input from the user.</p></li>
        <li><p><code>int()</code> - A function that converts a value to an integer.</p></li>
        <li><p><code>float()</code> - A function that converts a value to a float.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>These are called "built-in" functions because you don't have to import any modules to use them. They are just part of the Python language.</p>

    <pre><code class='python'># Calling some built-in functions
print("Hello!")
age = input("What's your name? ")
nextYear = int(age) + 1</code></pre>

    <h3>2. Standard Library Functions</h3>
    <p>You've also used a number of <dfn>standard library functions</dfn>. These are functions that come with Python, but require you to import a library or module to use. Grouping similar functions together in a library, helps to keep things organized.</p>
    <p>Some examples you've used include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><p><code>math.round()</code> - A function in the math module that rounds a number.</p></li>
        <li><p><code>string.upper()</code> - A function that converts a string to uppercase.</p></li>
        <li><p><code>list.append()</code> - A function that adds an item to a list.</p></li>
        <li><p><code>random.randint()</code> - A function that gives you a random number.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Notice that some of these functions are called by using the module name where the function is defined. Such as the <code>round()</code> function:</p>

    <pre><code class='python'>import math

# Round the number to 2 decimal places by 
# calling the round() function in the math module.
answer = math.round(1.2312344, 2)</code></pre>

    <p>Sometimes a function will belong to a particular data type.</p>
    <p>For example, the string data type contains a number of functions. When a variable contains a string, you can access its functions, using this syntax: <code>variable.functionName()</code>.</p>
    <p>Functions that belong to a particular data type are often referred to as <dfn>methods</dfn>. Methods tend to act directly on the object they belong to. For example the <code>string.upper()</code> method returns the uppercase equivalent of whatever string it's attached to:</p>

<pre><code class='python'>choice = input("What would you like to do? ")

# Call the upper() method attached to the string contained
# in the choice variable, in order to convert that string to
# uppercase.
if choice.upper() == "LEARN":
    print("That's a good choice.")</code></pre>

    <h3>3. Third-party Functions</h3>
    <p>Sometimes, you'll want your code to do something that isn't easily accomplished using only the built-in or standard library functions. In those cases, programmers often install third party modules (sometimes called "libraries"), in order to use additional functions that others have written.</p>
    <p>For example, the <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Pillow</a> module is a module you may have used in CSE 110. This module provides several functions for working with images.</p>
    <p>These libraries are usually installed using the <code>pip</code> tool. Once a library is installed, you can import it and use its functions just like any standard library function.</p>

    <h3>4. User-defined Functions</h3>

    <p>Often, programmers will write their own functions. Creating these <dfn>user-defined functions</dfn> provides several advantages:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><p>It makes your code more reusable.</p></li>
        <li><p>It makes your code easier to understand and debug.</p></li>
        <li><p>It makes it easier for you to make changes or add capabilities to your code.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>In this unit, you'll learn how to create your own user-defined functions in Python.</p>

    <h2>Defining a Function</h2>
    <p>All function definitions start with the keyword <dfn>def</dfn> (which stands for "define"), followed by the name of the function.</p>
    <p>Function definitions always end with a set of <code>()</code>'s, followed by a <code>:</code>.</p><p>You could read the following line of code as, "Define a function called sayHello."</p>

<pre><code class='python'>def sayHello():</code></pre>

    <p>Just like with other block level statements you've seen, such as <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, and <code>for</code>, (all of which also use <code>:</code>'s), the statements inside the <dfn>body</dfn> of a function are indented:</p>

<pre><code class='python'># Define a function called "sayHello"
def sayHello():
    # This is the "body" of the function.
    # When the sayHello function is "called", this is
    # the code that will execute:
    print("Hello!")
    print("Hope you have a good day!")</code></pre>

    <p>The concept of <dfn>defining</dfn> a function is important to remember. When we define a function, we're essentially saying:</p>

    <blockquote><p>Okay python, you know what functions like <code>print</code> and <code>input</code> mean, but I'm going to teach you a new function called <code>sayHello</code>. Whenever you see that function written down, I want you to execute the following statements...</p></blockquote>

    <h2>Calling a Function</h2>

    <p>You've been <dfn>calling</dfn> functions since you wrote your first <code>print()</code> statement. Calling user-defined functions works the same way. Once you've defined a function, you can call it using the function name followed by a set of <code>()</code>'s:</p>

<pre><code class='python'># Define the function
def sayHello():
    print("Hello")
    print("Hope you have a good day!")

# Call the function
sayHello()</code></pre>

    <h2>Function Parameters</h2>
    <p>Just as with other functions you've used, user-defined functions can make use of parameters.</p>
    <p>When you define a function, you specify its parameters inside of the <code>()</code>'s.</p><p>The code inside the body of the function can use those parameters like any other variable:</p>

<pre><code class='python'># Define a function that uses parameters.

# Whatever argument is passed to the function 
# when it is called, will be stored in the "numbers" 
# parameter, and will be accessible within the 
# body of the function.
def printAverage(numbers):
    total = 0
    for number in numbers:
        total += number

    average = total / len(numbers)
    print(f"The average is: {average}")</code></pre>

    <p>Calling a user defined function that requires parameters works exactly like other functions you've used:</p>

<pre><code class='python'>scores = [100, 90, 85, 84, 99]

# Call the printAverage function and pass the scores
# list as an argument. 
printAverage(scores)
</code></pre>

    <h2>Function Return Values</h2>
    <p>Many functions you've used in the past <dfn>return</dfn> a value. When a function returns a value, we usually store that value in a variable to use later.</p>

    <p>Here's a new version of the <code>printAverage</code> function that returns the average rather than printing it. Having a function return a value, instead of printing it, makes our functions more reusable.</p>

    <p>In the example below, notice that we changed the name of the function to <code>calculateAverage</code> instead of <code>printAverage</code>.</p>
    <p>Functions should always be named so that it's obvious what they do. Well-named functions almost always start with a verb.</p>

<pre><code class='python'># Define a function that uses parameters.
def calculateAverage(numbers):
    total = 0
    for number in numbers:
        total += number

    average = total / len(numbers)

    # The value we return will be available 
    # wherever the function was called from.
    return average


# Call the function and store its return value
# in a variable to use later.
scores = [100, 90, 85, 84, 99]
finalGrade = calculateAverage(scores)

if finalGrade >= 93:
    print("You got an A ðŸ¤©")
else:
    print("You did not get an A ðŸ˜ž")
</code></pre>

    <p>While it's usually a good practice, you don't <em>have</em> to store the return value of a function in a variable. Sometimes you'll see it used directly like in the following examples:</p>

<pre><code class='python'>scores = [100, 90, 85, 84, 99]

# Call the function and immediately print its return value:
print("The average is: ")
print( calculateAverage(scores) )

# Here we hold on to the return value just long enough to 
# ask the question in the if statement:
if calculateAverage(scores) >= 93:
    print("You got an A ðŸ¤©")
else:
    print("You did not get an A ðŸ˜ž")
</code></pre>

    <p>Notice that in the above example, we're calling the function twice. Once when we want to print the average, and again when we want to see if got an A or not. Every time you call a function, the code inside the function body is executed.</p>
    <p>In this case, since our argument is the same list of scores both times, the result will be the same in both cases. So it would be faster to save the result in a variable and reuse the variable instead:</p>

<pre><code class='python'>scores = [100, 90, 85, 84, 99]

# Call the function and store the result so 
# we can use it later.
finalGrade = calculateAverage(scores)

print("The average is: ")
print(finalGrade)

if finalGrade >= 93:
    print("You got an A ðŸ¤©")
else:
    print("You did not get an A ðŸ˜ž")
</code></pre>
