    <h1>05 Prove Milestone: Writing Functions</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write functions with parameters and call those
    functions with arguments by writing a program that draws an outdoor
    scene in a window.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Most modern computer operating systems have graphical user
    interfaces (GUIs) that are rich with colors, icons, images, menus,
    tabs, buttons, text fields, sliders, scroll bars, etc. However, many
    Python programs are designed to run in a console window, also called
    a terminal window, to read user input from a keyboard, and to print
    text as output to the console window. This means that many Python
    programs are not designed and written to take advantage of the rich
    features of graphical user interfaces.</p>

    <p>Python includes two competing libraries of code named
    <code>tkinter</code> and <code>kivy</code> that enable a program to
    have a user interface. Writing a program with a complete GUI is a
    large task. During this lesson and the next lesson, you will write a
    Python program that uses the <code>tkinter</code> library and
    draws a semi-realistic scene in a graphical window similar to this
    scene:</p>

    <p><img src="scene.png"
    alt="A semi-realistic outdoor scene drawn by a Python program"></p>

    <h2>Scene Gallery</h2>
    <p>All the scenes in
    <a href="../lesson06/gallery/index.html">this gallery</a>
    were drawn by programs written by former CSE 111 students.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Videos</h2>
    <p>The following videos walk through two examples of using functions
    to draw with <code>tkinter</code>.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>During this lesson, you will write code that draws the sky,
    the ground, and clouds. During the next lesson, you will write code
    that completes the scene. The scene that your program draws may be
    very different from the example scene above. However, your scene
    must be outdoor, the sky must have clouds, and the scene must
    include repetitive elements such as blades of grass, trees, leaves
    on a tree, birds, flowers, insects, fish, pickets in a fence, dashed
    lines on a road, buildings, bales of hay, snowmen, snowflakes, or
    icicles. Be creative.</p>

    <p>Each repetitive element must be drawn by a function that your
    program calls repeatedly, once for each repeated element. For
    example, your program may include a function named
    <code>draw_leaf</code> that your program repeatedly calls to draw
    all the leaves on a tree.</p>

    <p>The goal of this assignment is not to train you to become a
    world-famous cloud artist. Instead, the goal is to teach you how to
    apply the following principles to a real programming problem:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Writing a function</div></li>
        <li><div>Deciding what needs to be a parameter in a function
        definition</div></li>
        <li><div>Calling a function with different argument values to
        produce different results</div></li>
        <li><div>Understanding how to separate the parts of a function
        that should stay the same and the parts that depend on
        parameters, in order to make the function as reusable as
        possible.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Begin your program by copying and pasting the following code into
    a new file named <code>scene.py</code>. This beginning code imports
    several parts of the <code>tkinter</code> library and creates a
    window and a canvas that your program can draw to.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python" id="ex1">
import tkinter as tk


def main():
    # The width and height of the scene window.
    width = 800
    height = 500

    # Create the root Tk object.
    root = tk.Tk()
    root.geometry(f"{width}x{height}")

    # Create a Frame object.
    frame = tk.Frame()
    frame.master.title("Scene")
    frame.pack(fill=tk.BOTH, expand=1)

    # Create a canvas object that will draw into the frame.
    canvas = tk.Canvas(frame)
    canvas.pack(fill=tk.BOTH, expand=1)

    # Call the draw_scene function.
    draw_scene(canvas, 0, 0, width-1, height-1)

    root.mainloop()


def draw_scene(canvas, scene_left, scene_top, scene_right, scene_bottom):
    """Draw a scene in the canvas. scene_left, scene_top,
    scene_right, and scene_bottom contain the extent in
    pixels of the region where the scene should be drawn.
    Parameters:
        scene_left - left side of the region; less than scene_right
        scene_top - top of the region; less than scene_bottom
        scene_right - right side of the region
        scene_bottom - bottom of the region
    Return: nothing

    If needed, the width and height of the
    region can be calculated like this:
    scene_width = scene_right - scene_left + 1
    scene_height = scene_bottom - scene_top + 1
    """
    # Call your functions here, such as draw_sky, draw_ground,
    # draw_snowman, draw_tree, draw_shrub, etc.
    tree_center = scene_left + 500
    tree_top = scene_top + 100
    tree_height = 150
    draw_pine_tree(canvas, tree_center, tree_top, tree_height)


# Define more functions here, like draw_sky, draw_ground,
# draw_cloud, draw_tree, draw_kite, draw_snowflake, etc.

def draw_pine_tree(canvas, peak_x, peak_y, height):
    """Draw a single pine tree.
    Parameters:
        canvas: The tkinter canvas where this
            function will draw a pine tree.
        peak_x, peak_y: The x and y location in pixels where
            this function will draw the top peak of a pine tree.
        height: The height in pixels of the pine tree that
            this function will draw.
    Return: nothing
    """
    trunk_width = height / 10
    trunk_height = height / 8
    trunk_left = peak_x - trunk_width / 2
    trunk_right = peak_x + trunk_width / 2
    trunk_bottom = peak_y + height

    skirt_width = height / 2
    skirt_height = height - trunk_height
    skirt_left = peak_x - skirt_width / 2

    skirt_bottom = peak_y + skirt_height

    # Draw the trunk of the pine tree.
    canvas.create_rectangle(trunk_left, skirt_bottom,
            trunk_right, trunk_bottom,
            outline="gray20", width=1, fill="tan3")

    # Draw the crown (also called skirt) of the pine tree.
    canvas.create_polygon(peak_x, peak_y,
            skirt_right, skirt_bottom,
            skirt_left, skirt_bottom,

# Call the main function so that
# this program will start executing.
main()</pre></div>

    <p>Save your new file as <code>scene.py</code> and run your new
    Python program. When you run it, it should open a window that
    contains a single pine tree like this:</p>

    <p><img src="oval.png" alt="A blue circle drawn by a Python program"></p>

    <p>The pine tree was drawn because the code at line&nbsp;91 called
    the <code>main</code> function. At line&nbsp;22, the
    <code>main</code> function called the <code>draw_scene</code>
    function. At line&nbsp;48, the <code>draw_scene</code> function
    called the <code>draw_pine_tree</code> function and at
    lines&nbsp;78&ndash;83 the <code>draw_pine_tree</code> function
    called the <code>create_rectangle</code> and
    <code>create_polygon</code> methods.</p>

    <p>The purpose of this assignment is to prove that you can write and
    call functions. Therefore, your program must be divided into
    functions such as <code>draw_sky</code>, <code>draw_cloud</code>,
    <code>draw_ground</code>, <code>draw_bird</code>,
    <code>draw_grass_blade</code>, and <code>draw_insect</code>. The
    headers for the <code>draw_scene</code> and
    <code>draw_pine_tree</code> functions are good examples for the
    headers of all your draw_* functions. For example, if you write a
    <code>draw_grass_blade</code> function in your program, you could
    write its header like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">def draw_grass_blade(canvas, blade_left, blade_top, blade_right, blade_bottom):</pre></div>

    <p>Delete or comment-out lines&nbsp;45&ndash;48 and
    lines&nbsp;54&ndash;86 and begin writing your program. As you write
    your program, be sure that it draws elements in the order of
    farthest away to nearest. For example, you program should draw the
    blue sky first, then the ground, then clouds, then trees, then
    insects in the trees.</p>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each
    step in this testing procedure:</p>

    <ol class="test">
        <li><div>Run your program and verify that it correctly opens a
        window and draws within that window an outdoor scene that
        contains at least the sky, clouds, and the ground.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>On or before the due date, return to I-Learn and report your
    progress on this milestone.</p>
