    <h1>05 Prove Milestone: Testing and Fixing Functions</h1>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a Python program and write and run test
    functions to help you find and fix mistakes.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>The <dfn>Turing test</dfn>, named after Alan Turing, is a test of a
    computer's ability to make conversation that is indistinguishable
    from human conversation. A computer that could pass the Turing test
    would need to understand sentences typed by a human and respond with
    sentences that make sense.</p>

    <p>Write a Python program that generates simple English sentences.
    During this lesson, you will write and test functions that generate
    sentences with three parts: a determiner (sometimes known as an
    article), a noun, and a verb, such as these sentences:</p>

    <blockquote>The cat laughed.<br>
    Some girls thought.<br>
    One man eats.<br>
    Many dogs run.<br>
    The woman will think.<br>
    Many men will write.</blockquote>

    <p>During the next lesson, you will write and test functions that
    generate English sentences with the three parts and a prepositional
    phrase, such as these sentences:</p>

    <blockquote>One girl talked for the car.<br>
    Some dogs drank above many adults.<br>
    One bird drinks off one child.<br>
    Some children laugh at many dogs.<br>
    The child will run on the car.<br>
    Some adults will talk about some cats.</blockquote>

    <p>For this milestone assignment, your program must include at least
    these four functions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div><code>main</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>get_determiner</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>get_noun</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>get_verb</code></div></li>
    </ul>
    <!--
    <p>After the next lesson, your program must include at least these
    two additional functions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>get_prepositional_phrase</div></li>
        <li><div>get_preposition</div></li>
    </ul>
    -->
    <p>You may add other functions if you want. The functions
    <code>get_determiner</code>, <code>get_noun</code>, and
    <code>get_verb</code>, must randomly choose a word from a list of
    words and return the randomly chosen word.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <ul class="long">
        <li><div>In CSE&nbsp;110, you studied Python lists. You should
        recall that we create a Python list with square brackets and
        commas like this list of strings:

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
# Create a list of strings and assign
# the list to a variable named words.
words = ["boy", "girl", "cat", "dog", "bird", "house"]</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>The Python standard <code>random</code> module includes
        a function named
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice"><code>choice</code></a>
        that will randomly choose one element from a list and return
        that element. The choice function is easy to call like this:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">import random

# Create a list of strings and assign
# the list to a variable named words.
words = ["boy", "girl", "cat", "dog", "bird", "house"]

# Call the random.choice function which will choose
# one string from the words list. Store the chosen
# string in a variable named word.
word = <em>random.choice(words)</em></pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>The <a href="prepare.html">prepare</a> content for this
        lesson explains how to use <code>pytest</code> and
        <code>assert</code> to automatically verify that functions are
        correct. It also contains an <a href="prepare.html#example">example
        test function</a> and links to additional documentation about
        <code>pytest</code>.</div></li>

        <li><div>This <a href="https://content.byui.edu/items/a9e60503-b5e7-40f0-bf48-ebf1a7441d25/1/example_07.mp4">short video</a>
        shows a BYU-Idaho faculty member writing two test functions and
        using <code>pytest</code> to run them.</div></li>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Do the following:</p>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Using VS Code, create a new file, import the
        <code>random</code> module at the top of the file, and save the

    Parameter
        quantity: an integer. If quantity == 1, this function will
            return a determiner for a single noun. Otherwise this
            function will return a determiner for a plural noun.

        <li><div>Use the <code>get_determiner</code> function as an
        example to help you write the <code>get_verb</code> function.
        The <code>get_verb</code> function must have the following

        <li><div>Write the <code>main</code> function and any other

        <li><div>In a new file named test_sentences.py, write three test
        functions named <code>test_get_determiner</code>,

        Each of these three test functions must test one of the program
        functions: <code>get_determiner</code>, <code>get_noun</code>,
        and <code>get_verb</code>. The following example contains code
        for the <code>test_get_determiner</code> function. Copy and
        paste the code into your <code>test_sentences.py</code> file and
        use it as an example to help you write
        <code>test_get_noun</code> and <code>test_get_verb</code>.

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
from sentences import get_determiner, get_noun, get_verb

    # (_) as the variable name for the counting variable.
    for _ in range(4):

        assert word in single_determiners

    # 2. Test the plural determiners.

    plural_determiners = ["some", "many"]

    # This loop will repeat the statements inside it 4 times.

        # is one of the words in the plural_determiners list.
        assert word in plural_determiners</pre></div>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your test program works correctly by following each
    step in this procedure:</p>

    <ol class="test">
        <li><div>Run your <code>test_sentences.py</code> program and
        verify that all three of the test functions pass. If one or more
        of the tests don't pass, find and fix the mistakes in your
        program functions or test functions until the tests pass as
        shown in this output:

<pre class="console">&gt; python test_sentences.py

        </div></li>

        <li><div>Run your <code>sentences.py</code> program and ensure
        that your program outputs six sentences with the following
        characteristics:

        <table><thead>
            <tr><th></th> <th>Noun Quantity</th> <th>Verb Tense</th></tr>
        </thead><tbody>
            <tr><td>a.</td> <td>single</td> <td>past</td></tr>
            <tr><td>b.</td> <td>plural</td> <td>past</td></tr>
            <tr><td>c.</td> <td>single</td> <td>present</td></tr>
            <tr><td>d.</td> <td>plural</td> <td>present</td></tr>
            <tr><td>e.</td> <td>single</td> <td>future</td></tr>
            <tr><td>f.</td> <td>plural</td> <td>future</td></tr>
        </tbody></table>

        Your program's output should be similar to the sample run output
        shown here. However, because your program will randomly choose
        the determiners, nouns, and verbs, your program will generate
        different sentences than the ones shown here.

<pre class="console">&gt; python sentences.py
The cat laughed.
Some girls thought.
One man eats.
Many dogs run.
The woman will think.
Many men will write.</pre>
