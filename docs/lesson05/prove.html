    <h1>05 Prove Milestone: Draw a Scene</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write and call functions by writing a program
    that draws an outdoor scene in a window.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Most modern computer operating systems have graphical user
    interfaces (GUIs) that are rich with colors, icons, images, menus,
    tabs, buttons, text fields, sliders, scroll bars, etc. However, many
    Python programs are designed to run in a console window, also called
    a terminal window, to read user input from a keyboard, and to print
    text as output to the console window. This means that many Python
    programs are not designed and written to take advantage of the rich
    features of graphical user interfaces.</p>

    <p>Python includes two competing libraries of code named
    <code>tkinter</code> and <code>kivy</code> that enable a program to
    have a user interface. Writing a program with a complete GUI is a
    large task. During this lesson and the next lesson, you will write a
    Python program that uses the <code>tkinter</code> library and
    draws a semi-realistic scene in a graphical window similar to this
    scene:</p>

    <p><img src="scene.png"
    alt="A semi-realistic outdoor scene drawn by a Python program"></p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>

        href="http://zetcode.com/tkinter/drawing/">drawing with
        tkinter</a></div></li>

        <li><div>Reference for <a target="_blank"
        href="https://effbot.org/tkinterbook/canvas.htm">tkinter
        Canvas</a> widget</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>During this lesson, you will write code that draws the sky,
    the ground, and clouds. During the next lesson, you will write code
    that completes the scene. The scene that your program draws may be
    very different from the example scene above. However, your scene
    must be outdoor, the sky must have clouds, and the scene must
    include repetitive elements such as blades of grass, trees, leaves
    on a tree, birds, flowers, insects, fish, pickets in a fence, dashed
    lines on a road, buildings, bales of hay, snowmen, snowflakes, or
    icicles. Be creative.</p>

    <p>Each repetitive element must be drawn by a function that your
    program calls repeatedly, once for each repeated element. For
    example, your program may include a function named
    <code>draw_leaf</code> that your program repeatedly calls to draw
    all the leaves on a tree.</p>

    <p>Begin your program by copying and pasting the following code into
    a new file named <code>scene.py</code>. This beginning code imports
    several parts of the <code>tkinter</code> library and creates a
    window and a canvas that your program can draw to.</p>

<pre class="python">from tkinter import Tk, Canvas, Frame, BOTH


def main():
    # Create the root Tk object.
    root = Tk()

    # Create a Scene object which will call
    # the __init__ function in the Scene class.
    scene = Scene()

    root.geometry("800x600")
    root.mainloop()


class Scene(Frame):
    """A Scene object is a Frame that uses the tkinter library
    to draw a somewhat realistic outdoor scene in the frame.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize a Scene object."""

        # Call __init__ in the parent class.
        super().__init__()

        self.master.title("Scene")
        self.pack(fill=BOTH, expand=1)

        # Get a canvas object that will draw into this Scene object.
        canvas = Canvas(self)
        canvas.pack(fill=BOTH, expand=1)

        # Call the draw_scene function.
        draw_scene(canvas, 0, 0, 799, 599)


def draw_scene(canvas, left, top, right, bottom):
    """Draw a scene in the canvas. left, top, right, and bottom
    contain the extent in pixels of the region where the scene
    should be drawn.

    param left - left side of region; less than or equal to right
    param top - top of the region; less than or equal to bottom
    param right - right side of the region
    param bottom - bottom of the region

    The width and height of the region can be calculated like this:
    width = right - left + 1
    height = bottom - top + 1
    """
    canvas.create_oval(left + 20, top + 40, right - 60, bottom - 80,
            outline="#404040", width=4, fill="#2040e0")

    # Call your functions here, such as draw_sky, draw_ground,
    # draw_snowman, draw_tree, draw_shrub, etc.


# Add more functions here, like draw_sky, draw_ground,
# draw_cloud, draw_tree, draw_kite, draw_snowflake, etc.


# Call the main function so that
# this program will start executing.
main()</pre></div>

    <p>Save your new file as <code>scene.py</code> and run your new
    Python program. When you run it, it should open a window that
    contains a blue oval like this:</p>

    <p><img src="oval.png" alt="A blue oval drawn by a Python program"></p>

    <p>This oval was drawn by the code at lines 37 and 38. Delete lines
    37 and 38 and begin writing your program. The purpose of this
    assignment is to prove that you can write and call functions.
    Therefore, your program must be divided into functions such as
    <code>draw_sky</code>, <code>draw_cloud</code>,
    <code>draw_ground</code>, <code>draw_bird</code>,
    <code>draw_grass_blade</code>, and <code>draw_insect</code>. The
    header for the <code>draw_scene</code> function, which is shown in
    the example code above, is a good example for the headers of all
    your draw_* functions.</p>

    <p>As your write your program, be sure that it draws elements in the
    order of farthest away to nearest. For example, you program should
    draw the blue sky first, then the ground, then clouds, then trees,
    then insects in the trees.</p>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each
    step in this testing procedure:</p>

    <ol class="test">
        <li><div>Run your program and verify that it correctly opens a
        window and draws within that window an outdoor scene that
        contains at least the sky, clouds, and the ground.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>On or before the due date, return to I-Learn and report your
    progress on this milestone.</p>
