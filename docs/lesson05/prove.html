    <h1>05 Prove Milestone: Draw a Scene</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write functions with parameters and call those
    functions with arguments by writing a program that draws an outdoor
    scene in a window.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Most modern computer operating systems have graphical user
    interfaces (GUIs) that are rich with colors, icons, images, menus,
    tabs, buttons, text fields, sliders, scroll bars, etc. However, many
    Python programs are designed to run in a console window, also called
    a terminal window, to read user input from a keyboard, and to print
    text as output to the console window. This means that many Python
    programs are not designed and written to take advantage of the rich
    features of graphical user interfaces.</p>

    <p>Python includes two competing libraries of code named
    <code>tkinter</code> and <code>kivy</code> that enable a program to
    have a user interface. Writing a program with a complete GUI is a
    large task. During this lesson and the next lesson, you will write a
    Python program that uses the <code>tkinter</code> library and
    draws a semi-realistic scene in a graphical window similar to this
    scene:</p>

    <p><img src="scene.png"
    alt="A semi-realistic outdoor scene drawn by a Python program"></p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>

        href="http://zetcode.com/tkinter/drawing/">drawing with
        tkinter</a></div></li>

        Canvas</a> widget</div></li>

        <li><div><a target="_blank" href="colors.png">Chart of named
        colors</a> in tkinter</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>During this lesson, you will write code that draws the sky,
    the ground, and clouds. During the next lesson, you will write code
    that completes the scene. The scene that your program draws may be
    very different from the example scene above. However, your scene
    must be outdoor, the sky must have clouds, and the scene must
    include repetitive elements such as blades of grass, trees, leaves
    on a tree, birds, flowers, insects, fish, pickets in a fence, dashed
    lines on a road, buildings, bales of hay, snowmen, snowflakes, or
    icicles. Be creative.</p>

    <p>Each repetitive element must be drawn by a function that your
    program calls repeatedly, once for each repeated element. For
    example, your program may include a function named
    <code>draw_leaf</code> that your program repeatedly calls to draw
    all the leaves on a tree.</p>

    <p>Begin your program by copying and pasting the following code into
    a new file named <code>scene.py</code>. This beginning code imports
    several parts of the <code>tkinter</code> library and creates a
    window and a canvas that your program can draw to.</p>

<pre class="python">from tkinter import Tk, Frame, Canvas, BOTH


def main():
    width = 800
    height = 600

    # Create the root Tk object.
    root = Tk()
    root.geometry(f"{width}x{height}")

    # Create a Frame object.
    frame = Frame()
    frame.master.title("Scene")
    frame.pack(fill=BOTH, expand=1)

    # Create a canvas object that will draw into the frame.
    canvas = Canvas(frame)
    canvas.pack(fill=BOTH, expand=1)

    # Call the draw_scene function.
    draw_scene(canvas, 0, 0, width-1, height-1)

    root.mainloop()


def draw_scene(canvas, scene_left, scene_top, scene_right, scene_bottom):
    """Draw a scene in the canvas. scene_left, scene_top,
    scene_right, and scene_bottom contain the extent in
    pixels of the region where the scene should be drawn.

    param scene_left - left side of region; less than scene_right
    param scene_top - top of the region; less than scene_bottom
    param scene_right - right side of the region
    param scene_bottom - bottom of the region

    If needed, the width and height of the
    region can be calculated like this:
    scene_width = scene_right - scene_left + 1
    scene_height = scene_bottom - scene_top + 1
    """
    # Call your functions here, such as draw_sky, draw_ground,
    # draw_snowman, draw_tree, draw_shrub, etc.
    circle_left = scene_left + 500
    circle_top = scene_top + 100
    circle_diam = 150
    draw_example_circle(canvas, circle_left, circle_top, circle_diam)


# Define more functions here, like draw_sky, draw_ground,
# draw_cloud, draw_tree, draw_kite, draw_snowflake, etc.
def draw_example_circle(canvas, left, top, diameter):
    right = left + diameter
    bottom = top + diameter
    canvas.create_oval(left, top, right, bottom,
            outline="gray10", width=4, fill="blue")


# Call the main function so that
# this program will start executing.
main()</pre></div>

    <p>Save your new file as <code>scene.py</code> and run your new
    Python program. When you run it, it should open a window that
    contains a blue circle like this:</p>

    <p><img src="oval.png" alt="A blue circle drawn by a Python program"></p>

    <p>The circle was drawn because the <code>draw_scene</code> function
    called the <code>draw_example_circle</code> function. The circle was
    drawn by the code at lines&nbsp;55&ndash;56. Delete or comment-out
    lines&nbsp;44&ndash;47 and lines&nbsp;52&ndash;56 and begin writing
    your program.</p>

    <p>The purpose of this assignment is to prove that you can write and
    call functions. Therefore, your program must be divided into
    functions such as <code>draw_sky</code>, <code>draw_cloud</code>,
    <code>draw_ground</code>, <code>draw_bird</code>,
    <code>draw_grass_blade</code>, and <code>draw_insect</code>. The
    header for the <code>draw_scene</code> function, which is shown on
    line&nbsp;27 in the example code above, is a good example for the
    headers of all your draw_* functions. For example, if you write a
    <code>draw_grass_blade</code> function in your program, you could
    write its header like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">def draw_grass_blade(canvas, blade_left, blade_top, blade_right, blade_bottom):</pre></div>

    <p>As you write your program, be sure that it draws elements in the
    order of farthest away to nearest. For example, you program should
    draw the blue sky first, then the ground, then clouds, then trees,
    then insects in the trees.</p>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each
    step in this testing procedure:</p>

    <ol class="test">
        <li><div>Run your program and verify that it correctly opens a
        window and draws within that window an outdoor scene that
        contains at least the sky, clouds, and the ground.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>On or before the due date, return to I-Learn and report your
    progress on this milestone.</p>
