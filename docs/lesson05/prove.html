    <h1>05 Prove Milestone: Testing and Fixing Functions</h1>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a Python program and write and run test
    functions to help you find and fix mistakes.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>The <dfn>Turing test</dfn>, named after Alan Turing, is a test of
    a computer's ability to make conversation that is indistinguishable
    from human conversation. A computer that could pass the Turing test
    would need to understand sentences typed by a human and respond with
    sentences that make sense.</p>

    <p>In English and many other languages, <dfn>grammatical
    quantity</dfn> (also known as grammatical number) is an attribute of
    nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and verbs that expresses count
    distinctions, such as "one", "two", "some", or "many". The
    grammatical quantity of the words in a sentence must match. In
    English, there are two categories of grammatical quantity: single
    and plural. For example, here are three English sentences that
    contain <dfn>single</dfn> nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and
    verbs:</p>

    <blockquote>The boy laughs.<br>
    One dog eats.<br>
    She drinks water.</blockquote>

    <p>Here are three English sentences that contain <dfn>plural</dfn>
    nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and verbs:</p>

    <blockquote>Two birds fly.<br>
    Some animals eat grass.<br>
    Many cars are red.</blockquote>

    <p><dfn>Grammatical tense</dfn> is an attribute of verbs that
    expresses when an action happened. Many languages include past,
    present, and future tenses. For example, here are three English
    sentences, the first with past tense, the second with present tense,
    and the third with future tense:</p>

    <blockquote>The cat walked.<br>
    The cat walks.<br>
    The cat will walk.</blockquote>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Write a Python program named <code>sentences.py</code> that
    generates simple English sentences. During this prove milestone, you
    will write and test functions that generate sentences with three
    parts:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>a determiner (sometimes known as an article)</div></li>
        <li><div>a noun</div></li>
        <li><div>a verb</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>For example:</p>
    <blockquote>A cat laughed.<br>
    One man eats.<br>
    The woman will think.<br>
    Some girls thought.<br>
    Many dogs run.<br>
    Many men will write.</blockquote>

    <p>For this milestone , your program must include at least these
    four functions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div><code>main</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>get_determiner</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>get_noun</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>get_verb</code></div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>You may add other program functions if you want. The functions
    <code>get_determiner</code>, <code>get_noun</code>, and
    <code>get_verb</code>, must randomly choose a word from a list of
    words and return the randomly chosen word.</p>

    <p>In addition, for this milestone assignment, you must write a file
    named <code>test_senetences.py</code> that contains three functions
    named as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div><code>test_get_determiner</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>test_get_noun</code></div></li>
        <li><div><code>test_get_verb</code></div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>All the functions that you must write for this milestone
    assignment are described in the Steps section below.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <ul class="long">
        <li><div>In CSE&nbsp;110, you studied Python lists. You should
        recall that we create a Python list with square brackets and
        commas like this list of strings:

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
# Create a list of strings and assign
# the list to a variable named words.
words = ["boy", "girl", "cat", "dog", "bird", "house"]</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>The standard Python <code>random</code> module includes
        a function named
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice"><code>choice</code></a>
        that will randomly choose one element from a list and return
        that element. The choice function is easy to call like this:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">import random

# Create a list of strings and assign
# the list to a variable named words.
words = ["boy", "girl", "cat", "dog", "bird", "house"]

# Call the random.choice function which will choose
# one string from the words list. Store the chosen
# string in a variable named word.
word = <em>random.choice(words)</em></pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>The Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.capitalize">str.capitalize</a>
        method will capitalize the first letter in a word. The
        capitalize method is easy to call like this:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python"># This could be any word from any source.
word = "horse"

# Call the capitalize method which will
# capitalize the first letter of the word.
<em>cap_word = word.capitalize()</em></pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>The <a href="prepare.html">prepare</a> content for this
        lesson explains how to use <code>pytest</code> and
        <code>assert</code> to automatically verify that functions are
        correct. It also contains an <a href="prepare.html#example">example
        test function</a> and links to additional documentation about
        <code>pytest</code>.</div></li>

        <li><div>This <a href="https://content.byui.edu/items/a9e60503-b5e7-40f0-bf48-ebf1a7441d25/1/example_07.mp4">short video</a>
        <span class="duration">(20 minutes)</span> shows a BYU-Idaho
        faculty member writing two test functions and using
        <code>pytest</code> to run them.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Do the following:</p>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Using VS Code, create a new file, import the
        <code>random</code> module at the top of the file, and save the
        file as <code>sentences.py</code></div></li>

        <li><div>Copy and paste the following
        <code>get_determiner</code> function into your program.

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
def get_determiner(quantity):
    """Return a randomly chosen determiner. A determiner is
    a word like "the", "a", "one", "two", "some", "many".
    If quantity == 1, this function will return either "a",
    "one", or "the". Otherwise this function will return
    either "two", "some", "many", or "the".

    Parameter
        quantity: an integer.
            If quantity == 1, this function will return
            a determiner for a single noun. Otherwise this
            function will return a determiner for a plural noun.
    Return: a randomly chosen determiner.
    """
    if quantity == 1:
        words = ["a", "one", "the"]
    else:
        words = ["two", "some", "many", "the"]

    # Randomly choose and return a determiner.
    word = random.choice(words)
    return word</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Use the <code>get_determiner</code> function as an
        example to help you write the <code>get_noun</code> function.
        The <code>get_noun</code> function must have the following
        header and fulfill the requirements of the following
        documentation string.

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
def get_noun(quantity):
    """Return a randomly chosen noun.
    If quantity == 1, this function will
    return one of these ten single nouns:
        "bird", "boy", "car", "cat", "child",
        "dog", "girl", "man", "rabbit", "woman"
    Otherwise, this function will return one of
    these ten plural nouns:
        "birds", "boys", "cars", "cats", "children",
        "dogs", "girls", "men", "rabbits", "women"

    Parameter
        quantity: an integer that determines if
            the returned noun is single or plural.
    Return: a randomly chosen noun.
    """</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Use the <code>get_determiner</code> function as an
        example to help you write the <code>get_verb</code> function.
        The <code>get_verb</code> function must have the following
        header and fulfill the requirements of the following
        documentation string.

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
def get_verb(quantity, tense):
    """Return a randomly chosen verb. If tense is "past",
    this function will return one of these ten verbs:
        "drank", "ate", "grew", "laughed", "thought",
        "ran", "slept", "talked", "walked", "wrote"
    If tense is "present" and quantity is 1, this
    function will return one of these ten verbs:
        "drinks", "eats", "grows", "laughs", "thinks",
        "runs", "sleeps", "talks", "walks", "writes"
    If tense is "present" and quantity is NOT 1,
    this function will return one of these ten verbs:
        "drink", "eat", "grow", "laugh", "think",
        "run", "sleep", "talk", "walk", "write"
    If tense is "future", this function will return one of
    these ten verbs:
        "will drink", "will eat", "will grow", "will laugh",
        "will think", "will run", "will sleep", "will talk",
        "will walk", "will write"

    Parameters
        quantity: an integer that determines if the
            returned verb is single or plural.
        tense: a string that determines the verb conjugation,
            either "past", "present" or "future".
    Return: a randomly chosen verb.
    """</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div><p>Write the <code>main</code> function and any other
        functions that you think are necessary for your program to
        generate and print six sentences with these characteristics:</p>

        <table class="center"><thead>
            <tr><th></th> <th>Quantity</th> <th>Verb Tense</th></tr>
        </thead><tbody>
            <tr><td>a.</td> <td>single</td> <td>past</td></tr>
            <tr><td>b.</td> <td>single</td> <td>present</td></tr>
            <tr><td>c.</td> <td>single</td> <td>future</td></tr>
            <tr><td>d.</td> <td>plural</td> <td>past</td></tr>
            <tr><td>e.</td> <td>plural</td> <td>present</td></tr>
            <tr><td>f.</td> <td>plural</td> <td>future</td></tr>
        </tbody></table>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>In a new file named <code>test_sentences.py</code>,
        write three test functions named
        <code>test_get_determiner</code>, <code>test_get_noun</code>,
        and <code>test_get_verb</code>. Each of these three test
        functions must test one of the program functions:
        <code>get_determiner</code>, <code>get_noun</code>, and
        <code>get_verb</code>.</p>

        <p>Recall that each of the three program functions
        (<code>get_determiner</code>, <code>get_noun</code>, and
        <code>get_verb</code>) returns a word that the computer chooses
        randomly from a list of words. The random nature of the program
        functions makes the corresponding test functions a little
        difficult to implement. How do we write code to verify that a
        word chosen randomly is correct? One possible way is to verify
        that the chosen word is from the correct list. For example, if
        we write a call to the <code>get_determiner</code> function and
        pass 1 as the quantity like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">    determ = get_determiner(1)</pre></div>

        <p>Then the word in the <var>determ</var> variable should be in
        this list:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">    ["a", "one", "the"]</pre></div>

        <p>We can use the <code>assert</code> keyword and the Python
        membership operator, which is the keyword <code>in</code>, to
        verify that the word in the <var>determ</var> variable is in the
        list, like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">def test_get_determiner():
    # Call the get_determiner function.
    determ = get_determiner(1)

    # Verify that the word stored in the variable
    # determ is in the list of single determiners.
    words = ["a", "one", "the"]
    <em>assert determ in words</em></pre></div>

        <p>The following example contains code for
        the <code>test_get_determiner</code> function. Copy and paste
        the code into your <code>test_sentences.py</code> file and use
        it as an example to help you write <code>test_get_noun</code>
        and <code>test_get_verb</code>.

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
from sentences import get_determiner, get_noun, get_verb
import random
import pytest


def test_get_determiner():
    # 1. Test the single determiners.

    single_determiners = ["a", "one", "the"]

    # This loop will repeat the statements inside it 4 times.
    # If a loop's counting variable is not used inside the
    # body of the loop, many programmers will use underscore
    # (_) as the variable name for the counting variable.
    for _ in range(4):

        # Call the get_determiner function which
        # should return a single determiner.
        word = get_determiner(1)

        # Verify that the word returned from get_determiner
        # is one of the words in the single_determiners list.
        assert word in single_determiners

    # 2. Test the plural determiners.

    plural_determiners = ["two", "some", "many", "the"]

    # This loop will repeat the statements inside it 4 times.
    for _ in range(4):

        # Get a random number between 2 and 10 inclusive.
        quantity = random.randint(2, 11)

        # Call the get_determiner function which
        # should return a plural determiner.
        word = get_determiner(quantity)

        # Verify that the word returned from get_determiner
        # is one of the words in the plural_determiners list.
        assert word in plural_determiners</pre></div>
        </div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your test program works correctly by following each
    step in this procedure:</p>

    <ol class="test">
        <li><div>Run your <code>test_sentences.py</code> program and
        verify that all three of the test functions pass. If one or more
        of the tests don't pass, find and fix the mistakes in your
        program functions or test functions until the tests pass as
        shown in this output:

<pre class="console">&gt; python test_sentences.py
=================== test session starts ====================

<span class="pass">==================== 3 passed in 0.10s =====================</span></pre>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Run your <code>sentences.py</code> program and ensure
        that your program outputs six sentences with the following
        characteristics:

        <table class="center"><thead>
            <tr><th></th> <th>Quantity</th> <th>Verb Tense</th></tr>
        </thead><tbody>
            <tr><td>a.</td> <td>single</td> <td>past</td></tr>
            <tr><td>b.</td> <td>single</td> <td>present</td></tr>
            <tr><td>c.</td> <td>single</td> <td>future</td></tr>
            <tr><td>d.</td> <td>plural</td> <td>past</td></tr>
            <tr><td>e.</td> <td>plural</td> <td>present</td></tr>
            <tr><td>f.</td> <td>plural</td> <td>future</td></tr>
        </tbody></table>

        Your program's output should be similar to the sample run output
        shown here. However, because your program randomly chooses the
        determiners, nouns, and verbs, your program will generate
        different sentences than the ones shown here.

<pre class="console">&gt; python sentences.py
The cat laughed.
Some girls thought.
One man eats.
Many dogs run.
The woman will think.
Many men will write.</pre>
        </div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Ponder</h2>
    <p>During this assignment, you wrote four program functions named
    <code>main</code>, <code>get_determiner</code>,
    <code>get_noun</code>, and <code>get_verb</code>. Also, in a
    separate file, you wrote three test functions named
    <code>test_get_determiner</code>, <code>test_get_noun</code>, and
    <code>test_get_verb</code>. Each of the test functions called one of
    the program functions and automatically verified that the value
    returned from the program function was correct. If you worked as a
    software developer on a large project with four other software
    developers, how would test functions help you and the other
    developers write better code?</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>On or before the due date, return to I-Learn and report your
    progress on this milestone.</p>
