    <h1>05 Prove: Draw a Scene</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write and call functions by writing a program
    that draws an outdoor scene in a window.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Most modern computer operating systems have graphical user
    interfaces (GUIs) that are rich with colors, icons, images, menus,
    tabs, buttons, text fields, sliders, scroll bars, etc. However, many
    Python programs are designed to run in a console window, also called
    a terminal window, to read user input from a keyboard, and to print
    text as output to the console window. This means that many Python
    programs are not designed and written to take advantage of the rich
    features of graphical user interfaces.</p>

    <p>Python includes two competing libraries of code named
    <code>tkinter</code> and <code>kivy</code> that enable a program to
    have a user interface. Writing a program with a complete GUI is a
    large task. During this lesson and the next lesson, you will write a
    Python program that uses the <code>tkinter</code> library and that
    draws a semi-realistic scene in a graphical window similar to this
    scene:</p>

    <p><img src="scene.png"
    alt="A semi-realistic outdoor scene drawn by a Python program"></p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><div>A tutorial about <a target="_blank"
        href="http://zetcode.com/tkinter/drawing/">drawing with
        tkinter</a></div></li>

        <li><div>Reference for <a target="_blank"
        href="https://effbot.org/tkinterbook/canvas.htm">tkinter
        Canvas</a> widget</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Begin your program by copying and pasting the following code into
    a new file named <code>scene.py</code>. This beginning code imports
    several parts of the <code>tkinter</code> library and creates a
    window and a canvas that your program can draw to.</p>

    <div class="pre"><pre class="python">from tkinter import Tk, Canvas, Frame, BOTH


def main():
    root = Tk()
    scene = Scene()
    root.geometry("800x600")
    root.mainloop()

class Scene(Frame):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.initUI()

    def initUI(self):
        self.master.title("Scene")
        self.pack(fill=BOTH, expand=1)
        canvas = Canvas(self)
        draw_scene(canvas, 0, 0, 799, 599)
        canvas.pack(fill=BOTH, expand=1)


def draw_scene(canvas, left, top, right, bottom):
    """Draw a scene in the canvas. left, top, right, and bottom contain
    the extent in pixels of the region where the scene should be drawn.

    left - left side of region; less than or equal to right
    top - top of the region; less than or equal to bottom
    right - right side of the region
    bottom - bottom of the region

    The width and height of the region can be calculated like this:
    width = right - left + 1
    height = bottom - top + 1
    """
    canvas.create_oval(left + 20, top + 40, right - 60, bottom - 80,
            outline="#404040", width=4, fill="#2040e0")


main()</pre></div>

        <li><div></div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Run</h2>
<pre class="console">&gt;
</pre>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each
    step in this testing procedure:</p>
