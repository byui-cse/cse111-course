    <h1>05 Prove Milestone: Writing Functions</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write functions with parameters and call those
    functions with arguments by writing a program that draws an outdoor
    scene in a window.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Most modern computer operating systems have graphical user
    interfaces (GUIs) that are rich with colors, icons, images, menus,
    tabs, buttons, text fields, sliders, scroll bars, etc. However, many
    Python programs are designed to run in a console window, also called
    a terminal window, to read user input from a keyboard, and to print
    text as output to the console window. This means that many Python
    programs are not designed and written to take advantage of the rich
    features of graphical user interfaces.</p>

    <p>Python includes two competing libraries of code named
    <code>tkinter</code> and <code>kivy</code> that enable a program to
    have a user interface. Writing a program with a complete GUI is a
    large task. During this lesson and the next lesson, you will write a
    Python program that uses the <code>tkinter</code> library and
    draws a semi-realistic scene in a graphical window similar to this
    scene:</p>

    <p><img class='figure' src="scene.png"
    alt="A semi-realistic outdoor scene drawn by a Python program"></p>

    <h2>Helpful Videos</h2>
    <p>The following videos walk through two examples of using functions to draw with tkinter:</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>During this lesson, you will write code that draws the sky,
    the ground, and clouds. During the next lesson, you will write code
    that completes the scene. The scene that your program draws may be
    very different from the example scene above. However, your scene
    must be outdoor, the sky must have clouds, and the scene must
    include repetitive elements such as blades of grass, trees, leaves
    on a tree, birds, flowers, insects, fish, pickets in a fence, dashed
    lines on a road, buildings, bales of hay, snowmen, snowflakes, or
    icicles. Be creative.</p>

    <p>Each repetitive element must be drawn by a function that your
    program calls repeatedly, once for each repeated element. For
    example, your program may include a function named
    <code>draw_leaf</code> that your program repeatedly calls to draw
    all the leaves on a tree.</p>

    <p>The goal of this assignment is not to train you to become a
    world-famous cloud artist. Instead, the goal is to teach you how to
    apply the following principles to a real programming problem:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Writing a function</p></li>
        <li><p>Deciding what needs to be a parameter in a function
        definition</p></li>
        <li><p>Calling a function with different argument values to
        produce different results</p></li>
        <li><p>Understanding how to separate the parts of a function
        that should stay the same and the parts that depend on
        parameters, in order to make the function as reusable as
        possible.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Begin your program by copying and pasting the following code into
    a new file named <code>scene.py</code>. This beginning code imports
    several parts of the <code>tkinter</code> library and creates a
    window and a canvas that your program can draw to.</p>

<pre><code class="python">from tkinter import Tk, Frame, Canvas, BOTH

def main():
    width = 800
    height = 600

    # Create the root Tk object.
    root = Tk()
    root.geometry(f"{width}x{height}")

    # Create a Frame object.
    frame = Frame()
    frame.master.title("Scene")
    frame.pack(fill=BOTH, expand=1)

    # Create a canvas object that will draw into the frame.
    canvas = Canvas(frame)
    canvas.pack(fill=BOTH, expand=1)

    # Call the draw_scene function.
    draw_scene(canvas, 0, 0, width-1, height-1)

    root.mainloop()


def draw_scene(canvas, scene_left, scene_top, scene_right, scene_bottom):
    """Draw a scene in the canvas. scene_left, scene_top,
    scene_right, and scene_bottom contain the extent in
    pixels of the region where the scene should be drawn.

    param scene_left - left side of the region; less than scene_right
    param scene_top - top of the region; less than scene_bottom
    param scene_right - right side of the region
    param scene_bottom - bottom of the region

    If needed, the width and height of the
    region can be calculated like this:
    scene_width = scene_right - scene_left + 1
    scene_height = scene_bottom - scene_top + 1
    """
    # Call your functions here, such as draw_sky, draw_ground,
    # draw_snowman, draw_tree, draw_shrub, etc.


# Define more functions here, like draw_sky, draw_ground,
# draw_cloud, draw_tree, draw_kite, draw_snowflake, etc.


# Call the main function so that
# this program will start executing.
main()</pre></code>

    <p>Save your new file as <code>scene.py</code> and run your new
    Python program. When you run it, you should see a blank white canvas appear.</p>


    <p>The purpose of this assignment is to prove that you can write and
    call functions. Therefore, your program must be divided into
    functions such as <code>draw_sky</code>, <code>draw_cloud</code>,
    <code>draw_ground</code>, <code>draw_bird</code>,
    <code>draw_grass_blade</code>, and <code>draw_insect</code>. The
    headers for the <code>draw_scene</code> and
    <code>draw_pine_tree</code> functions are good examples for the
    headers of all your draw_* functions. For example, if you write a
    <code>draw_grass_blade</code> function in your program, you could
    write its header like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def draw_grass_blade(canvas, blade_left, blade_top, blade_right, blade_bottom):</code></pre>

    <h2>Example</h2>

    <p>For example, <a href='./tree_example.py'>this code</a> draws the following image:</p>
    <p><img src="tree.png" class="figure" alt="A pine tree drawn by a Python program"></p>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each
    step in this testing procedure:</p>

    <ol class="test">
        <li><div>Run your program and verify that it correctly opens a
        window and draws within that window an outdoor scene that
        contains at least the sky, clouds, and the ground.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>On or before the due date, return to I-Learn and report your
    progress on this milestone.</p>
