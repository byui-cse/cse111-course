    <h1>05 Checkpoint: Fuel Efficiency</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Demonstrate your understanding of writing your own functions with
    parameters and then calling those functions by completing the
    following individual checkpoint assignment.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Many vehicle owners record the fuel efficiency of their vehicles
    as a way to track the health of the vehicle. If the fuel efficiency
    of a vehicle suddenly drops, there is probably something wrong with
    the engine or drive train of the vehicle. In the United States, fuel
    efficiency for gasoline powered vehicles is computed as miles per
    gallon. In most other countries, fuel efficiency is computed as
    liters per 100 kilometers.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Download this file: <a download
    href="fuel_usage.csv">fuel_usage.csv</a> and save it in the same
    folder where you will save your Python program. Open the file in VS
    Code and notice that it contains four columns: date, start, end,
    gallons.</p>

    <p>Write a program that does the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Reads odometer values in miles and fuel amounts in
        gallons from a CSV file.</div></li>
        <li><div>Computes and outputs fuel efficiency in both miles per
        gallon and liters per 100 kilometers.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Use the following design to write your Python program:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
# Import necessary modules.


def main():
    # Print this header: "Date,Miles/Gallon,Liters/100 Km"

    # Open the fuel_usage.csv file for reading.

    # Use the csv module to get a reader object.

    # Process each row in the csv file by calling the
    # miles_per_gallon and lp100k_from_mpg functions.

    # Print the date, miles per gallon, and liters
    # per 100 kilometers as comma separated values.
    pass


def miles_per_gallon(start, end, gallons):
    """Compute and return fuel efficiency in miles per gallon.

    param start: the starting odometer reading in miles
    param end: the ending odometer reading in miles
    param gallons: amount of fuel used in U.S. gallons
    """
    pass


def lp100k_from_mpg(mpg):
    """Convert miles per gallon to liters per
    100 kilometers and return the converted value.

    param mpg: a fuel efficiency value in miles per gallon
    """
    pass


# Call the main function so that
# this program will start executing.

</pre></div>

    <p>Use this formula in the <code>miles_per_gallon</code> function:
    <div class="blockExpr">mpg = <div>end - start<hr>gallons</div></div>
    and this formula in the <code>lp100k_from_mpg</code> function:
    <div class="blockExpr">lp100k = <div>235.215<hr>mpg</div></div></p>

    <h2>Sample Run</h2>
<pre class="console">&gt; python check_solution.py
Date,Miles/Gallon,Liters/100 Km
2019-Sep-2,30.6,7.69
2019-Sep-9,29.5,7.96
2019-Sep-16,30.7,7.66
2019-Sep-23,31.8,7.4
2019-Sep-30,29.1,8.07</pre>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="test">
        <li><div>Run your program using the input shown in the sample
        run section above. Ensure that your program's output matches the
        sample run output.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>When your program is finished, view the <a download
    href="check_solution.py">sample solution</a> for this assignment to
    compare your solution to that one. Before looking at the sample
    solution, you should work to complete this checkpoint program first.
    However, if you have worked on it for at least an hour and are still
    having problems, feel free to use the sample solution to help you
    finish your program.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When complete, report your progress in the associated I-Learn
    quiz.</p>
