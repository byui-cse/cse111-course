    <h1>05 Checkpoint: Writing Functions</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Demonstrate your understanding of writing your own functions with
    parameters and then calling those functions by completing the
    following individual checkpoint assignment.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Many vehicle owners record the fuel efficiency of their vehicles
    as a way to track the health of the vehicle. If the fuel efficiency
    of a vehicle suddenly drops, there is probably something wrong with
    the engine or drive train of the vehicle. In the United States, fuel
    efficiency for gasoline powered vehicles is computed as miles per
    gallon. In most other countries, fuel efficiency is computed as
    liters per 100 kilometers.</p>

    <p>The formula for computing fuel efficiency in miles per gallon
    is the following:</p>
    <div class="blockExpr">mpg = <div>end - start<hr>gallons</div></div>
    <p>where <var>start</var> and <var>end</var> are both odometer
    readings in miles and <var>gallons</var> is a fuel amount in U.S.
    gallons.</p>

    <p>The formula for converting miles per gallon to liters per 100
    kilometers is the following:</p>
    <div class="blockExpr">lp100k = <div>235.215<hr>mpg</div></div>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <p>A CSV file is a text file that contains a list of data. Within
    each row of a CSV file, the data items are separated by a character
    which is usually a comma. The term "CSV" is an acronym for "comma
    separated values." Python includes a module with functions for
    processing CSV files. Read about the Python <code>csv</code> module
    in the official Python documentation about the <a target="_blank"
    href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html"><code>csv</code>
    module</a>.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Download the <a download href="fuel_usage.csv">fuel_usage.csv</a>
    file and save it in the same folder where you will save your Python
    program. Open the file in VS Code and notice that it contains four
    columns: Date, Start, End, and Usage (in U.S. gallons).</p>

    <p>Write a Python program named <code>fuel_usage.py</code> that
    reads odometer values in miles and fuel amounts in gallons from a
    CSV file and computes and outputs fuel efficiency in both miles per
    gallon and liters per 100 kilometers. To start your program, copy
    and paste the following code into your program and use it as a
    design as you write your program.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python"># Import necessary modules.
import csv


def main():
    # Print headers for the three columns.
    print("Date,Miles/Gallon,Liters/100 Km")

    # Open the CSV file fuel_usage.csv
    with open("fuel_usage.csv", "rt") as infile:

        # Use the standard csv module to get
        # a reader object for the CSV file.
        reader = csv.reader(infile)

        # The first line of the CSV file contains headings
        # and not fuel usage data, so this statement skips
        # the first line of the CSV file.
        next(reader)

        # Process each row in the CSV file.
        for row in reader:

            # From the current row of the CSV file, get the
            # date as a string. Don't bother to convert the
            # date from a string to a date object because the
            # only thing this program will do with the date is
            # print it, and a string works great for printing.
            date = row[0]

            # From the current row of the CSV file, get
            # starting and ending odometer readings.
            start = float(row[1])
            end = float(row[2])

            # From the current row of the CSV file, get
            # the number of gallons of fuel used.
            gallons = float(row[3])

            # Call the miles_per_gallon function.
            mpg = miles_per_gallon(start, end, gallons)

            # Call the lp100k_from_mpg function to convert the
            # miles per gallon to liters per 100 kilometers.
            lp100k = lp100k_from_mpg(mpg)

            # Display the results for one row in the csv file.
            print(date, round(mpg, 1), round(lp100k, 2), sep=",")


def miles_per_gallon(start, end, gallons):
    """Compute and return the average miles that
    a vehicle traveled per gallon of fuel.
    start and end are odometer readings in miles.
    gallons is a fuel amount in U.S. gallons.
    """
    pass


def lp100k_from_mpg(mpg):
    """Convert miles per gallon to liters per 100
    kilometers and return the converted value.
    """
    pass


# Call the main function so that

    <h2>Sample Run</h2>
<pre class="console">&gt; python check_solution.py

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Run your program using the input shown in the sample
        run section above. Ensure that your program's output matches the
        sample run output.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>When your program is finished, view the <a download
    href="check_solution.py">sample solution</a> for this assignment to
    compare your solution to that one. Before looking at the sample
    solution, you should work to complete this checkpoint program first.
    However, if you have worked on it for at least an hour and are still
    having problems, feel free to use the sample solution to help you
    finish your program.</p>
