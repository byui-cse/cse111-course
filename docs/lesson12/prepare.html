    <h1>12 Prepare: Using Objects</h1>
    <p>A <a target="_blank"
    href="https://www.google.com/search?q=define+paradigm"><dfn>paradigm</dfn></a>
    is a way of thinking or a way of viewing the world. There are at
    least four main paradigms for programming a computer: procedural
    (sometimes called imperative), declarative, functional, and object
    oriented. During CSE 110 and 111, you used or encountered the first
    three of these programming paradigms. During this lesson, you will
    be exposed to the last.</p>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <h3>Procedural Programming</h3>
    <p>Procedural programming is a way of programming that focuses on
    the process or the steps to accomplish a task. For example, if we
    had 100 numbers and wanted to know the average value of those 100
    numbers, we could add the numbers and then divide by 100. This is
    one process to compute the average of numbers: add them and divide
    by the quantity of numbers. A Python procedural program for
    computing the average looks like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">numbers = [87, 95, 72, 92, 95, 88, 84]
total = 0
for x in numbers:
    total += x
average = total / len(numbers)</pre></div>

    <p>Notice that with procedural programming, we must code the process
    or the steps that are necessary to complete a task. Procedural
    programming is the type of programming that you did most often in
    CSE 110 and 111.</p>

    <h3>Declarative Programming</h3>
    <p>When we use declarative programming to program a computer, we
    don't focus on the process or steps to accomplish a task, but rather
    we focus on what we want from the task. Continuing the example of
    the average, with declarative programming, we focus on exactly what
    numbers we want the average of and then tell the computer to compute
    that average for us. Many of the commands in <code>pandas</code> are
    a form of declarative programming. For example, using
    <code>pandas</code>, we can command the computer to filter a
    DataFrame or to remove columns from a DataFrame like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">import pandas

# Read a DataFrame from the water.csv file.
data = pandas.read_csv("water.csv")

# Filter the DataFrame to only rows from residences.
residence = data[data["accountType"] == "Residence"]

# Remove all columns except meterNumber, readDate, and usage.
residence = residence[["meterNumber", "readDate", "usage"]]</pre></div>

    <p>Notice in the above example, that the code doesn't contain the
    steps required to filter a DataFrame or remove columns because
    someone else already wrote those steps. Instead, the code contains
    commands that tell the computer what rows or columns we want to keep
    in the data, and the computer executes the steps necessary to do
    what we want. The term "declarative programming" means that we write
    or declare what we want the computer to do. We do not tell the
    computer how to compute something. We declare what we want the
    computer to do, and the computer determines how to do it and then
    does it.</p>

    <h3>Functional Programming</h3>
    <p>When we use functional programming to program a computer, we
    focus on the functions necessary to accomplish a task.
    Mathematicians often find functional programming is natural for them
    because they are accustomed to using functions while studying
    mathematics. In functional programming, functions are so important
    that we often pass functions into other functions. You did this in
    lesson 9 when you passed a function into the pandas
    <code>apply</code> function. Here is a functional programming
    solution to computing the average in Python:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">from functools import reduce

def add(a, b):
    """Return the sum of two numbers."""
    return a + b

numbers = [...]
average = reduce(add, numbers) / len(numbers)</pre></div>

    <p>Notice how this simple example uses three functions:
    <code>reduce</code>, <code>add</code>, and <code>len</code>. Notice
    also that the <code>add</code> function is passed into the
    <code>reduce</code> function. Passing a function into a function is
    the hallmark of functional programming.</p>

    <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
    <p>With object oriented programming, we use objects to write a
    program. An object is anything in the world that has these four
    things:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>identity (a name or identification)</div></li>
        <li><div>data (also known as attributes)</div></li>
        <li><div>behavior (also known as methods or functions)</div></li>
        <li><div>relationships to other objects</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>When we write an object oriented program we combine data and
    functions together into objects. For example, if we were writing a
    registration program used for students to register for courses at a
    school, we would write code to create Student objects and Course
    objects. Each Student object would have data like given_name,
    family_name, phone_number, etc. and would have methods like
    register, enroll, drop, withdraw, etc. Each Course object would have
    data like course_code, title, description, list_of_students, etc.
    and would have methods like get_students, take_role, etc.</p>

    <p>The <code>pandas</code> module uses object oriented programming
    concepts as shown in the next code example that again computes the
    average of a list of numbers.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">import pandas

# Read the data in a CSV file and create a pandas DataFrame object.
df = <em>pandas.read_csv("water.csv")</em>

# Extract a pandas Series object from the DataFrame object.
column = df["usage"]

# Call the mean method (function) that is in the column object.
average = <em>column.mean()</em>

# Print the column name attribute and the average.
print(<em>column.name</em>, average)</pre></div>

    <p>The hallmark of object oriented programming is selecting
    attributes and calling methods using the dot (.) operator. The
    official name of the <dfn>dot operator</dfn> is <dfn>component
    selector</dfn> but almost no one calls it that because the term dot
    is much easier to say than component selector. Notice in the
    previous example, the code uses the dot operator (.) to call the
    <code>read_csv</code> method in the pandas module, to call the
    <code>mean</code> method on the column, and to retrieve the column's
    <code>name</code> attribute.</p>

    <p>Python includes many built-in and standard objects that a
    programmer can use to write programs. In fact, you have already used
    many objects in your programs. In Python, tuples, lists, sets, and
    dictionaries are all objects and have attributes and methods. For
    example, lists have many methods: index, count, clear, insert,
    append, remove, pop, extend, reverse, and copy. csv Readers and
    Writers are also objects, as are pandas DataFrames and Series.</p>
