<article>
    <h1>12 Prepare: Using Objects</h1>
    <p>A <dfn>paradigm</dfn> is a way of thinking or a way of viewing
    the world. There are at least four main paradigms for programming a
    computer:&nbsp; procedural, declarative, functional, and
    object-oriented. During CSE&nbsp;110 and&nbsp;111, you used or
    encountered the first three of these programming paradigms. During
    this lesson, you will be introduced to the last:&nbsp;
    object-oriented programming.</p>

    <h2>Programming Paradigms</h2>
    <h3>Procedural Programming</h3>
    <p>Procedural programming is a way of programming that focuses on
    the process or the steps to accomplish a task. For example, if we
    had 100 numbers and wanted to know the average value of those 100
    numbers, we could add the numbers and then divide by 100. This is
    one process to compute the average of numbers:&nbsp; add them and
    divide by the quantity of numbers. A Python procedural program for
    computing the average is shown in example&nbsp;1.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex1"># Example 1

def main():
    numbers = [87, 95, 72, 92, 95, 88, 84]
    total = 0
    for x in numbers:
        total += x
    average = total / len(numbers)
    print(average)</pre></div>

    <p>Notice that with procedural programming, we must write the
    process or the steps that are necessary to complete a task.
    Procedural programming is the type of programming that you did most
    often in CSE&nbsp;110 and&nbsp;111.</p>

    <h3>Declarative Programming</h3>
    <p>When we use declarative programming to program a computer, we do
    not focus on the process or steps to accomplish a task, but rather
    we focus on what we want from the task, or in other words, we focus
    on the desired result. Continuing the example of the average, with
    declarative programming, we focus on exactly what numbers we want
    averaged and tell the computer to compute that average for us. SQL
    is a declarative programming language used with relational
    databases. Example&nbsp;2 contains SQL code that causes the computer
    to compute average of a column of numbers.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex2">-- Example 2

SELECT AVG(numbers) FROM table;</pre></div>

    <p>Notice in example&nbsp;2, that the code does not contain the
    steps required to compute the average of numbers. Someone else
    already wrote the code that contains those steps. Instead, the SQL
    code contains a command that tells the computer to compute the
    average of a column named <var>numbers</var>. The term "declarative
    programming" means that we write or declare what we want the
    computer to do. We do not tell the computer how to compute
    something. We declare what we want the computer to do, and the
    computer determines how to do it and then does it.</p>

    <h3>Functional Programming</h3>
    <p>When we use functional programming to program a computer, we
    focus on the functions necessary to accomplish a task.
    Mathematicians often find functional programming natural for them
    because they are accustomed to using functions while studying
    mathematics. In functional programming, functions are so important
    that we often pass functions into other functions. You did this in
    the checkpoint and team activity for lesson&nbsp;11. Example&nbsp;3
    contains a functional programming solution to computing the average
    in Python.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex3"># Example 3

from functools import reduce

def main():
    numbers = [87, 95, 72, 92, 95, 88, 84]
    func_add = lambda a, b: a + b
    total = <em>reduce(func_add, numbers)</em>
    average =  total / len(numbers)
    print(average)</pre></div>

    <p>Notice how example&nbsp;3 uses three functions:&nbsp; a lambda
    function, the <code>reduce</code> function, and the <code>len</code>
    function. Notice also that the lambda function is passed into the
    <code>reduce</code> function. Passing a function into a function is
    one of the marks of functional programming.</p>

    <h3>Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
    <p>Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on
    the concept of objects. An object is a piece of a program that
    contains both data (also known as attributes) and functions (also
    known as methods).</p>

    <p>When we write an object-oriented program, we combine data and
    functions together into objects. For example, if we were writing a
    registration program used for students to register for courses at a
    school, we would write code to create Student objects and Course
    objects. Each Student object would have data such as given_name,
    family_name, and phone_number and would have functions such as
    register, enroll, drop, and withdraw. Each Course object would have
    data such as course_code, title, description, and list_of_students
    and would have functions such as get_students and take_role.</p>

    <p>Python includes many built-in and standard objects that a
    programmer can use to write programs. In fact, you have already used
    many objects in your programs. Python lists and dictionaries are
    objects and have attributes and methods. Readers and Writers from
    the <code>csv</code> module are also objects.</p>

    <p>One of the marks of object-oriented programming is selecting
    attributes and calling methods using the <dfn>dot operator</dfn> (a
    period). The official name of the dot operator is <dfn>component
    selector</dfn>, but almost no one calls it that because the term
    "dot" is much easier to say than "component selector." The code in
    example&nbsp;4 uses the dot operator (.) to call the
    <code>append</code> method.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex4"># Example 4

def main():
    numbers = [87, 95, 72, 92, 95, 88, 84]
    <em>numbers.append(78)</em>
    <em>numbers.append(72)</em>

</pre></div>

    <p>There are several types of commands that are commonly found in
    object-oriented programs. These types of commands are so common,
    that a programmer must be able to recognize and write them. Three of
    these types of commands are:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Creating objects, for example:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">obj = datetime.now()</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Accessing the attributes of an object using the dot
        operator, for example:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">year = obj.year</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Calling the methods of an object using the dot
        operator, for example:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">new_obj = obj.replace(year=2025)</pre></div>
        </div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Python Lists Are Objects</h2>
    <p>In Python, lists are objects with attributes and methods, and a
    programmer can modify the contents of a list by calling those
    methods. The list methods are documented in a section of the Python
    Tutorial titled
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists">More on Lists</a>.</p>

    <p>Example&nbsp;5 contains a program copied from the
    <a href="../lesson07/prepare.html">prepare content</a>
    of lesson&nbsp;7. Now that you know what an object is, that objects
    have methods, and that Python lists are objects, this example code
    should ake more sense than it did in lesson&nbsp;7. Notice that the
    <code>append</code> method is called on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">lines&nbsp;8&ndash;10</span>,
    <code>insert</code> is called on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">line&nbsp;13</span>,
    <code>index</code> is called on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">line&nbsp;16</span>,
    <code>pop</code> is called on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">line&nbsp;22</span>, and
    <code>remove</code> is called on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">line&nbsp;25</span>.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python" id="ex5"># Example 5

def main():
    # Create an empty list that will hold fabric names.
    fabrics = []

    # Add three elements at the end of the fabrics list.
    fabrics.append("velvet")
    fabrics.append("denim")
    fabrics.append("gingham")

    # Insert an element at the beginning of the fabrics list.
    fabrics.insert(0, "chiffon")

    # Get the index where velvet is stored in the fabrics list.
    i = fabrics.index("velvet")

    # Replace velvet with taffeta.
    fabrics[i] = "taffeta"

    # Remove the last element from the fabrics list.
    fabrics.pop()

    # Remove denim from the fabrics list.
    fabrics.remove("denim")


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>


    <h2>Python Dictionaries Are Objects</h2>
    <p>Python dictionaries are objects with attributes and methods, and
    a programmer can modify the contents of a dictionary by calling those
    methods. There doesn't seem to be an official Python web page that
    documents the dictionary methods, so here is a list of the built-in
    dictionary methods:</p>

    <table><thead>
        <tr><th>Method</th> <th>Description</th></tr>
    </thead><tbody>
        <tr><td>d.clear()</td>
            <td>Removes all the elements from the dictionary
            <var>d</var>.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>d.copy()</td>
            <td>Returns a copy of the dictionary <var>d</var>.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>d.get(key)</td>
            <td>Returns the value of the specified <code>key</code>.
            Calling the get method is almost equivalent to using square
            brackets ([&nbsp;and&nbsp;]) to find a key in a
            dictionary.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>d.items()</td>
            <td>Returns a list of the key value pairs in the dictionary
            <var>d</var>.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>d.keys()</td>
            <td>Returns a list that contains the keys that are in the
            dictionary <var>d</var>.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>d.pop(key)</td>
            <td>Removes the element with the specified <var>key</var>
            from the dictionary <var>d</var>.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>d.update(other)</td>
            <td>Updates the dictionary <var>d</var> with the key value
            pairs that are in the <var>other</var> dictionary.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>d.values()</td>
            <td>Returns a list of all the values in the dictionary
            <var>d</var>.</td></tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p>The following example code, which is from the
    <a href="../lesson03/prepare.html">prepare content</a>
    of lesson&nbsp;3, calls dictionary methods at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex6">lines&nbsp;20,
    28,&nbsp;and&nbsp;36</span>.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python" id="ex6">
def main():
    # Create a dictionary with student IDs as
    # the keys and student names as the values.
    students = {
        "42-039-4736": "Clint Huish",
        "61-315-0160": "Michelle Davis",
        "10-450-1203": "Jorge Soares",
        "75-421-2310": "Abdul Ali",
        "07-103-5621": "Michelle Davis"
    }

    # Add an item to the dictionary.
    students["81-298-9238"] = "Sama Patel"

    # Get a student ID from the user.
    id = input("Enter a student ID: ")

    # Lookup the student ID in the dictionary and
    # retrieve the corresponding student name.
    name = <em>students.get(id)</em>

    if name:
        # Print the student name.
        print(name)

        # Remove the student that the user
        # specified from the dictionary.
        <em>students.pop(id)</em>
    else:
        print("No such student")

    # Use a for loop to print each key value pair in the
    # dictionary. Of course, the code in the body of a loop
    # can do much more with each key value pair than simply
    # print it.
    for key, value in <em>students.items()</em>:
        print(key, value)


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>This lesson is introducing you to object-oriented programming.
    You are learning that an object has data (attributes) and functions
    (methods) and that a programmer uses the dot operator (.) to access
    the attributes and methods in an object. Python lists and
    dictionaries are objects and contain attributes and methods.</p>
