    <h1>12 Prepare: Using Objects</h1>
    <p>A <dfn>paradigm</dfn> is a way of thinking or a way of viewing
    the world. There are at least four main paradigms for programming a
    computer: procedural, declarative, functional, and object-oriented.
    During CSE 110 and 111, you used or encountered the first three of
    these programming paradigms. During this lesson, you will be
    introduced to the last: object-oriented.</p>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <h3>Procedural Programming</h3>
    <p>Procedural programming is a way of programming that focuses on
    the process or the steps to accomplish a task. For example, if we
    had 100 numbers and wanted to know the average value of those 100
    numbers, we could add the numbers and then divide by 100. This is
    one process to compute the average of numbers: add them and divide
    by the quantity of numbers. A Python procedural program for
    computing the average looks like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex1">
numbers = [87, 95, 72, 92, 95, 88, 84]
total = 0
for x in numbers:
    total += x
average = total / len(numbers)</pre></div>

    <p>Notice that with procedural programming, we must code the process
    or the steps that are necessary to complete a task. Procedural
    programming is the type of programming that you did most often in
    CSE 110 and 111.</p>

    <h3>Declarative Programming</h3>
    <p>When we use declarative programming to program a computer, we do
    not focus on the process or steps to accomplish a task, but rather
    we focus on what we want from the task, or in other words, we focus
    on the desired result. Continuing the example of the average, with
    declarative programming, we focus on exactly what numbers we want
    averaged and tell the computer to compute that average for us. Many
    of the commands in the <code>pandas</code> module are a form of
    declarative programming. For example, using <code>pandas</code>, we
    can command the computer to filter a DataFrame or to remove columns
    from a DataFrame like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex2">
import pandas as pd

# Read a DataFrame from the water.csv file.
df = pd.read_csv("water.csv")

# Filter the DataFrame to only rows from residences.
filter = (df["accountType"] == "Residence")
residences = <em>df[filter]</em>

# Remove all columns except meterNumber, readDate, and usage.
retain = ["meterNumber", "readDate", "usage"]
residences = <em>residences[retain]</em></pre></div>

    <p>Notice in the above example, that the code does not contain the
    steps required to filter a DataFrame or remove columns because
    someone else already wrote the code that contains those steps.
    Instead, the code contains commands that tell the computer what rows
    or columns we want to keep in the data, and the computer executes
    the steps necessary to do what we want. The term "declarative
    programming" means that we write or declare what we want the
    computer to do. We do not tell the computer how to compute
    something. We declare what we want the computer to do, and the
    computer determines how to do it and then does it.</p>

    <h3>Functional Programming</h3>
    <p>When we use functional programming to program a computer, we
    focus on the functions necessary to accomplish a task.
    Mathematicians often find functional programming natural for them
    because they are accustomed to using functions while studying
    mathematics. In functional programming, functions are so important
    that we often pass functions into other functions. You did this in
    lesson&nbsp;11 when you passed a function into the pandas
    <code>apply</code> function. Here is a functional programming
    solution to computing the average in Python:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex3">
from functools import reduce

numbers = [87, 95, 72, 92, 95, 88, 84]
func_add = lambda a, b: a + b
total = <em>reduce(func_add, numbers)</em>
average =  total / len(numbers)</pre></div>

    <p>Notice how this simple example uses three functions:
    <code>reduce</code>, a lambda function, and <code>len</code>. Notice
    also that the lambda function is passed into the <code>reduce</code>
    function. Passing a function into a function is one of the marks of
    functional programming.</p>

    <h3>Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
    <p>With object-oriented programming, we use objects to write a
    program. An object is anything in the world that has these four
    things:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>identity (a name or identification)</div></li>
        <li><div>data (also known as attributes)</div></li>
        <li><div>behavior (also known as methods or functions)</div></li>
        <li><div>relationships to other objects</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>When we write an object-oriented program, we combine data and
    functions together into objects. For example, if we were writing a
    registration program used for students to register for courses at a
    school, we would write code to create Student objects and Course
    objects. Each Student object would have data like given_name,
    family_name, phone_number, etc. and would have functions like
    register, enroll, drop, withdraw, etc. Each Course object would have
    data like course_code, title, description, list_of_students, etc.
    and would have functions like get_students, take_role, etc.</p>

    <p>The <code>pandas</code> module uses object-oriented programming
    concepts as shown in the next code example that again computes the
    average of a list of numbers.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex4">
import pandas as pd

# Read the data in a CSV file and create a pandas DataFrame object.
df = <em>pd.read_csv("water.csv")</em>

# Extract a pandas Series object from the DataFrame object.
column = df["usage"]

# Call the mean method (function) that is in the column object.
average = <em>column.mean()</em>

# Print the column name attribute and the average.
print(<em>column.name</em>, average)</pre></div>

    <p>One of the marks of object-oriented programming is selecting
    attributes and calling methods using the <dfn>dot operator</dfn> (a
    period: .). The official name of the dot operator is <dfn>component
    selector</dfn>, but almost no one calls it that because the term
    "dot" is much easier to say than "component selector." Notice in the
    previous example, the code uses the dot operator (.) to call the
    <code>read_csv</code> method in the pandas module, to call the
    <code>mean</code> method on the column, and to retrieve the column's
    <code>name</code> attribute.</p>

    <p>Python includes many built-in and standard objects that a
    programmer can use to write programs. In fact, you have already used
    many objects in your programs. In Python, tuples, lists, sets, and
    dictionaries are all objects and have attributes and methods. For
    example, lists have many methods: <code>index</code>,
    <code>count</code>, <code>clear</code>, <code>insert</code>,
    <code>append</code>, <code>remove</code>, <code>pop</code>,
    <code>extend</code>, <code>reverse</code>, and <code>copy</code>.
    <code>csv</code> Readers and Writers are also objects, as are
    <code>pandas</code> DataFrames and Series.</p>

    <p>There are several types of commands that are commonly found in
    object-oriented programs. These types of commands are so common,
    that a programmer must be able to recognize and write them. Three of
    these types of commands are:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Creating objects. For example:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">obj = date.today()</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Accessing the attributes of an object using the dot
        operator. For example:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">y = obj.year</pre></div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Calling the methods of an object using the dot
        operator. For example:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">new_obj = obj.replace(year=2025)</pre></div>
        </div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Python Lists Are Objects</h2>
    <p>In Python, lists are objects with attributes and methods, and a
    programmer can modify the contents of a list by calling those
    methods. The list methods are documented in a section of the Python
    Tutorial titled
    <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists">More on Lists</a>.</p>

    <p>Here is example code from the
    <a target="_blank" href="../lesson03/prepare.html">prepare content</a>
    of lesson&nbsp;3. Now that you know what an object is, that objects
    have methods, and that Python lists are objects, this example code
    should make more sense than it did in lesson&nbsp;3. Notice that the
    <code>list.append</code> method is called on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">lines&nbsp;5&ndash;7</span>.
    <code>list.insert</code> is called on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">line&nbsp;10</span>;
    <code>list.index</code> is called on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">line&nbsp;13</span>;
    <code>list.pop</code> is called on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">line&nbsp;19</span>; and
    <code>list.remove</code> is called on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">line&nbsp;22</span>.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python" id="ex5">
# Create an empty list that will hold fabric names.
fabrics = []

# Add three elements at the end of the fabrics list.
fabrics.append("velvet")
fabrics.append("denim")
fabrics.append("gingham")

# Insert an element at the beginning of the fabrics list.
fabrics.insert(0, "chiffon")

# Get the index where velvet is stored in the fabrics list.
i = fabrics.index("velvet")

# Replace velvet with taffeta.
fabrics[i] = "taffeta"

# Remove the last element from the fabrics list.
fabrics.pop()

# Remove denim from the fabrics list.
fabrics.remove("denim")</pre></div>


    <h2>Python Dictionaries Are Objects</h2>
    <p>Python dictionaries are objects with attributes and methods, and
    a programmer can modify the contents of a dictionary by calling those
    methods. There doesn't seem to be an official Python web page that
    documents the dictionary methods, so here is a list of the built-in
    dictionary methods:</p>

    <table><thead>
        <tr><th>Method</th> <th>Description</th></tr>
    </thead><tbody>
        <tr><td>d.clear()</td>
            <td>Removes all the elements from the dictionary
            <var>d</var>.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>d.copy()</td>
            <td>Returns a copy of the dictionary <var>d</var>.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>d.get(key)</td>
            <td>Returns the value of the specified <code>key</code>.
            Calling the get method is almost equivalent to using
            square brackets ([ and ]) to look up a value in a
            dictionary.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>d.items()</td>
            <td>Returns a list of the key value pairs in the dictionary
            <var>d</var>.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>d.keys()</td>
            <td>Returns a list that contains the keys that are in the
            dictionary <var>d</var>.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>d.pop(key)</td>
            <td>Removes the element with the specified <var>key</var>
            from the dictionary <var>d</var>.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>d.update(other)</td>
            <td>Updates the dictionary <var>d</var> with the key value
            pairs that are in the <var>other</var> dictionary.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>d.values()</td>
            <td>Returns a list of all the values in the dictionary
            <var>d</var>.</td></tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p>The following example code, which is from the
    <a target="_blank" href="../lesson03/prepare.html">prepare content</a>
    of lesson&nbsp;3, calls dictionary methods at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex6">lines&nbsp;19,
    27,&nbsp;and&nbsp;34</span>.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python" id="ex6">
# Create a dictionary with student IDs as
# the keys and student names as the values.
students = {
    "42-039-4736": "Clint Huish",
    "61-315-0160": "Michelle Davis",
    "10-450-1203": "Jorge Soares",
    "75-421-2310": "Abdul Ali",
    "07-103-5621": "Michelle Davis"
}

# Add an item to the dictionary.
students["81-298-9238"] = "Sama Patel"

# Get a student ID from the user.
id = input("Enter a student ID: ")

# Lookup the student ID in the dictionary and
# retrieve the corresponding student name.
name = students.get(id)

if name:
    # Print the student name.
    print(name)

    # Remove the student that the user
    # specified from the dictionary.
    students.pop(id)
else:
    print("No such student")

# Use a for loop to print each key value pair in the
# dictionary. Of course, the code in the body of a loop can
# do much more with each key value pair than simply print it.
for key, value in students.items():
    print(key, value)</pre></div>
