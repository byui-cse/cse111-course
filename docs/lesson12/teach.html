    <h1>12 Team Activity: Program with a GUI</h1>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Arrange a one hour synchronous meeting with your team for this
    activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing meeting.
    Campus students will use class time for this meeting. You should
    prepare for this meeting by completing the preparation material and
    the individual checkpoint assignment beforehand.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Almost all of the programs that you have written for this course
    receive input from and print results to a console (also called
    terminal) window. However, most users prefer to interact with a
    program through a graphical user interface (GUI) that contains
    icons, text fields, dropdown lists, buttons, etc. Within a GUI, the
    individual components (icons, text fields, etc.) are called widgets.
    Most libraries for creating GUIs use object oriented programming
    because each widget is an object with attributes and methods.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><div>Official documention for the <a target="_blank" href="">tkinter module</a></div></li>

        <li><div>GUI <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_gui_programming.htm">Programming with Tkinter</a></div></li>

        <li><div>An <a target="_blank" href="https://effbot.org/tkinterbook/">Introduction to Tkinter</a></div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Write a Python program that gets user input from a GUI, performs
    a simple calculation, and displays the result in a GUI. Do the
    following:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Download these two Python files:
        <a download href="heart_rate.py">heart_rate.py</a> and
        <a download href="number_entry.py">number_entry.py</a>
        and save them in the same folder where you will save your Python
        program.</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the <code>heart_rate.py</code> file in VS
        Code and run it. Notice how running the program opens a GUI
        where a user can enter his age and see heart rates for
        exercising. Experiment with the GUI by entering different ages,
        seeing the results, and clicking the "Clear" button.</div></li>

        <li><div>Read the comments and examine the code in
        <code>heart_rate.py</code>. Notice the following:
        <ol>
            <li><div>To create its GUI, the heart_rate program uses the
            <code>tkinter</code> module which is imported at
            line&nbsp;1.</div></li>

            <li><div>The <code>main</code> function begins at
            line&nbsp;5.</div></li>

            <li><div><code>main</code> creates a <code>tk.TK</code> root
            object named <var>app</var> and uses that object to create a
            <code>HeartWindow</code> object.</div></li>

            <li><div>Beginning at line&nbsp;21, the
            <code>HeartWindow.__init__</code> method creates labels,
            text fields, and buttons and places them in a
            grid.</div></li>

            <li><div>Inside the <code>__init__</code> method, there
            are two nested functions named <code>calc</code> and
            <code>clear</code>. The <code>calc</code> function is called
            each time the user enters a digit in the age text field. The
            <code>clear</code> function is called each time the user
            clicks the "Clear" button.</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>

        <li><div>Choose a simple calculation or formula for your program
        to calculate. You could choose one of these:

        <ul>
            <li><div>Area of a circle: <div class="inlineExpr"><var>a</var> = &pi;<var>r</var><sup>2</sup></div></div></li>

            <li><div>Swing time of a pendulum: <div class="inlineExpr"><var>t</var> = 2&pi; &radic; <div><hr><div><var>n</var><hr>9.81</div></div></div></div></li>

            <li><div>Area of a rectangle: <div class="inlineExpr"><var>a</var> = <var>w</var><var>h</var></div></div></li>

            <li><div>Volume of a tire: <div class="inlineExpr"><var>v</var> = <div>&pi; <var>w</var><sup>2</sup> <var>a</var> (<var>w</var><var>a</var> + 2,540 <var>d</var>)<hr>10,000,000</div></div></div></li>
        </ul></div></li>

        <li><div>Use the heart_rate.py program as a reference (you could
        even copy and paste parts it) and write a Python program with a
        GUI that calculates the formula that you chose.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Your program must include a GUI that opens when your
        run your program.</div></li>

        <li><div>The GUI must allow a user to enter input.</div></li>

        <li><div>When the user enters valid input, your program must
        compute correct results and display those results in the
        GUI.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an hour,
    complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that the
    stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Add a "Clear" button to your GUI that clears all inputs
        and outputs when the user clicks it.</div></li>

        <li><div>Add a label that acts as a status bar at the bottom of
        your GUI. Your program should display an error message in the
        status bar when the user enters invalid input. Your program
        should clear the status bar when the user enters valid
        input.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Run your program and enter various inputs, including invalid
    values. Verify that your program doesn't crash, behaves as expected,
    and displays correct results.</p>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
    <a download href="teach_solution.py">sample solution</a>. Please
    <strong>do not look at the sample solution</strong> until you have
    either finished the program or diligently worked for at least one
    hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling to
    complete the assignment, you may use the sample solution to help you
    finish.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
