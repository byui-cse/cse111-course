# The controls in a graphical user interface (GUI) are called widgets,
# and each widget is an object. Because a GUI has many widgets and each
# widget is an object, the code to make a GUI usually has many variables
# to store the many objects. Because there are so many variable names,
# programmers often adopt a naming convention to help a programmer keep
# track of all the variables. One popular naming convention is to type a
# three letter prefix in front of the names of all variables that store
# GUI widgets, according to this list:
#
# frm: a frame (window) widget
# lbl: a label widget that displays text for the user to see
# ent: an entry widget where a user will type text or numbers
# btn: a button widget that the user will click
