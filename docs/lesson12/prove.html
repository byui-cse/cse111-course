    <h1>12 Prove Milestone: Significant Python Program</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a significant Python program that is
    well organized and solves a real-world problem. Your program must
    include multiple functions that you verify are correct with test
    functions and <code>pytest</code>.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Continue developing the program that you started in the
    <a href="../lesson11/prove.html">prove assignment</a> for
    lesson&nbsp;11.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>At the end of this lesson, you must complete this lesson's Prove:
    Milestone quiz in I-Learn. Your teacher or teaching assistant will
    grade your work according to this rubric:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Time&mdash;50%: Did you spend at least three hours on
        your program during this lesson?</div></li>

        <li><div>Organization&mdash;20%: Is your program organized into
        multiple functions and does each function perform just one
        task?</div></li>

        <li><div>Finished Work&mdash;20%: Did you complete some
        significant part of your program, including test functions,
        during the current lesson?</div></li>

        <li><div>Description&mdash;10%: Is the description of your work
        complete and easily understandable? At the end of each lesson,
        you will submit a description of your work. This description
        should follow normal English rules of spelling and grammar. It
        must include the following:
        <ol>
            <li><div>The amount of time that you spent working on your
            program during the current lesson.</div></li>
            <li><div>A list of the function names in your program.</div></li>
            <li><div>A list of the test function names in your
            test code.</div></li>
            <li><div>A list of the documentation that you read, the
            videos that you watched, and the coding experiments that you
            tried.</div></li>
            <li><div>A list of the work that you finished on your
            program.</div></li>
