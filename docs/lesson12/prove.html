    <h1>12 Prove Milestone: Significant Python Program</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a significant Python program that is
    well organized and solves a real world problem. Your program must
    include multiple functions that you verify are correct with test
    functions and <code>pytest</code>.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Continue developing the program that you started in the
    <a href="../lesson11/prove.html">prove assignment</a> for
    lesson&nbsp;11.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>At the end of this lesson, you must complete this lesson's Prove:
    Milestone quiz in I-Learn. Your teacher or teaching assistant will
    grade your work according to this rubric:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Time - 50%: Did you spend at least three hours on your
        program during this lesson?</div></li>

        <li><div>Organization - 20%: Is your program organized into
        multiple functions and does each function perform just one
        task?</div></li>

        <li><div>Finished Work - 20%: Did you complete some significant
        part of your program, including test functions, during the
        current lesson?</div></li>

        <li><div>Description - 10%: Is the description of your work
        complete and easily understandable? At the end of each lesson,

        must include the following:
        <ol>
            <li><div>The amount of time that you spent working on your
            program during the current lesson.</div></li>
            <li><div>A list of the function names in your program.</div></li>
            <li><div>A list of the test function names in your
