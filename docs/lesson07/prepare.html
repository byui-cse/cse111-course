    <h1>07 Prepare: Lists and Repetition</h1>
    <p>During this lesson, you will learn how to store many elements in
    a Python list. You will learn how to write a loop that processes
    each element in a list. Also, you will learn that lists are passed
    into a function differently than numbers are passed.</p>

    <h2 id="review">Review</h2>
    <p>For some students repetition (sometimes called loops) and lists
    are challenging topics that require significant effort and practice
    to master. Here are links to the preparation content from
    CSE&nbsp;110 about loops and lists that you should review before you
    learn the concepts in this lesson.</p>

    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn during this lesson:</p>

    <section>
    <h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
    <p>A Python program can store many values in a <dfn>list</dfn>.
    Lists are mutable, meaning they can be changed after they are
    created. Each value in a list is called an <dfn>element</dfn> and is
    stored at a unique index. An <dfn>index</dfn> is always an integer
    and determines where an element is stored in a list. The first index
    of a Python list is always zero (0). The following diagram shows a
    list that contains five strings. The diagram shows both the elements
    and the indexes of the list. Notice that each index is a unique
    integer, and that the first index is zero.</p>

    <figure class="center list">
        <table><tbody>
            <tr class="elems"><td class="label">elements</td>
                <td>"yellow"</td> <td>"red"</td> <td>"green"</td>
                <td>"yellow"</td> <td>"blue"</td></tr>
            <tr><td class="label">indexes</td> <td>[0]</td> <td>[1]</td>
                <td>[2]</td> <td>[3]</td> <td>[4]</td></tr>
            <tr><td></td>
                <td colspan="5">← list length is 5 →</td></tr>
        </tbody></table>
    </figure>

    <p>In a Python program, we can create a list by using square
    brackets ([&nbsp;and&nbsp;]). We can determine the number of items
    in a list by calling the built-in <code>len</code> function. We can
    retrieve an item from a list and replace an item in a list using
    square brackets ([&nbsp;and&nbsp;]) and an index. Example&nbsp;1
    contains a program that creates a list, prints the length of the
    list, retrieves and prints one item from the list, changes one item
    in the list, and then prints the entire list.</p>

<div class="example" id="ex1">
<pre class="python"># Example 1

def main():
    # Create a list that contains five strings.
    colors = ["yellow", "red", "green", "yellow", "blue"]

    # Call the built-in len function
    # and print the length of the list.
    length = len(colors)
    print(f"Number of elements: {length}")

    # Print the element that is stored
    # at index 2 in the colors list.
    print(colors[2])

    # Change the element that is stored at
    # index 3 from "yellow" to "purple".
    colors[3] = "purple"

    # Print the entire colors list.
    print(colors)


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre>

<pre class="console">&gt; python example_1.py
Number of elements: 5
green
['yellow', 'red', 'green', 'purple', 'blue']</pre>
</div>

    <p>We can add an item to a list by using the <code>insert</code> and
    <code>append</code> methods. We can determine if an element is in a
    list by using the Python membership operator, which is the keyword
    <code>in</code>. We can find the index of an item within a list by
    using the <code>index</code> method. We can remove an item from a
    list by using the <code>pop</code> and <code>remove</code> methods.
    Example&nbsp;2 shows how to create a list and add, find, and remove
    items from a list.</p>

<div class="example" id="ex2"><pre class="python"># Example 2

def main():
    # Create an empty list that will hold fabric names.
    fabrics = []

    # Add three elements at the end of the fabrics list.
    fabrics.append("velvet")
    fabrics.append("denim")
    fabrics.append("gingham")

    # Insert an element at the beginning of the fabrics list.
    fabrics.insert(0, "chiffon")
    print(fabrics)

    # Determine if gingham is in the fabrics list.
    if "gingham" in fabrics:
        print("gingham is in the list.")
    else:
        print("gingham is NOT in the list.")

    # Get the index where velvet is stored in the fabrics list.
    i = fabrics.index("velvet")

    # Replace velvet with taffeta.
    fabrics[i] = "taffeta"

    # Remove the last element from the fabrics list.
    fabrics.pop()

    # Remove denim from the fabrics list.
    fabrics.remove("denim")

    # Get the length of the fabrics list and print it.
    n = len(fabrics)
    print(f"The fabrics list contains {n} elements.")
    print(fabrics)


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre>

<pre class="console">&gt; python example_2.py
['chiffon', 'velvet', 'denim', 'gingham']
gingham is in the list.
The fabrics list contains 2 elements.
['chiffon', 'taffeta']</pre>
</div>

    <p>The lists in examples&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;2 store strings. Of course,
    it is possible to store numbers in a list, too. In fact, Python
    allows a program to store any data type in a list, including other
    lists.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h3 id="repetition">Repetition</h3>
    <p>A programmer can cause a computer to repeat a group of statements
    by writing <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops.</p>

    <h4 id="for">for loop</h4>
    <p>A <code>for</code> loop iterates over a sequence, such as a list.
    This means a <code>for</code> loop causes the computer to repeatedly
    execute the statements in the body of the <code>for</code> loop,
    once for each element in the sequence. In example&nbsp;3, consider
    the list of colors at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex3">line&nbsp;5</span>
    and the <code>for</code> loop at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex3">lines&nbsp;8&ndash;9</span>.
    Notice how the <code>for</code> loop causes the computer to repeat
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex3">line&nbsp;9</span> once for each
    element in the <var>colors</var> list. Of course, the code in the
    body of a loop can do much more with each element than simply print
    it.</p>

<div class="example" id="ex3"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 3

def main():
    # Create a list of color names.
    colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue"]

    # Use a for loop to print each element in the list.
    <em>for color in colors:
        print(color)</em>


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre>

<pre class="console">&gt; python example_3.py
red
orange
yellow
green
blue</pre>
</div>

    <p>Notice in example&nbsp;3 at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex3">lines&nbsp;8&ndash;9</span> that
    just like <code>if</code> statements in Python, the body of a loop
    starts and ends with indentation.</p>

    <h4 id="range">range function</h4>
    <p>The Python built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range"><code>range</code> function</a>
    creates and returns a sequence of numbers. The <code>range</code>
    function accepts one, two, or three parameters as shown in
    example&nbsp;4 and its output. Many programmers use the
    <code>range</code> function in a <code>for</code> loop to cause the
    computer to repeat code once for each number in a range of numbers.
    Example&nbsp;4 shows four <code>for</code> loops that iterate over a
    range of numbers.</p>

<div class="example" id="ex4"><pre class="python"># Example 4

def main():
    # Count from zero to nine by one.
    for i in range(10):
        print(i)
    print()

    # Count from five to nine by one.
    for i in range(5, 10):
        print(i)
    print()

    # Count from zero to eight by two.
    for i in range(0, 10, 2):
        print(i)
    print()

    # Count from 100 down to 70 by three.
    for i in range(100, 69, -3):
        print(i)


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre>

</div>

    <p>In example&nbsp;5 at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">lines&nbsp;8&ndash;9</span> and
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">lines&nbsp;15&ndash;17</span>,
    there are two <code>for</code> loops. Both loops print each element
    from a list named <var>colors</var>. The first loop iterates over
    the elements in the <var>colors</var> list. The second loop uses the
    built-in <code>len</code> and <code>range</code> functions to
    iterate over the indexes of the <var>colors</var> list. Which style
    of <code>for</code> loop do you prefer to read and write? Most
    programmers prefer to write a loop like the one at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">lines&nbsp;8&ndash;9</span>
    because it is simpler than the one at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">lines&nbsp;15&ndash;17</span>.</p>

<div class="example" id="ex5"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 5

def main():
    # Create a list of color names.
    colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue"]

    # Use a for loop to print each element in the list.
    <em>for color in colors:
        print(color)</em>

    print()

    # Use a different for loop to
    # print each element in the list.
    <em>for i in range(len(colors)):</em>
        # Use the index i to retrieve
        # an element from the list.
        <em>color = colors[i]

        print(color)</em>


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre>

<pre class="console">&gt; python example_5.py
red
orange
yellow
green
blue

red
orange
yellow
green
blue</pre>
</div>

    <p>In the previous example, the code in the body of both
    <code>for</code> loops is very short and simply prints one element
    from the list each time through the loop. However, you can write as
    many lines of code as you need in the body of a loop to repeatedly
    perform all sorts of computations for each element in a list.</p>

    <h4 id="break">break statement</h4>
    <p>A <code>break</code> statement causes a loop to end early. In
    example&nbsp;6 at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex6">lines&nbsp;8&ndash;12</span>,
    there is a <code>for</code> loop that asks the user to input ten
    numbers one at a time. However, the loop will terminate early if the
    user enters a zero (0) because of the <code>if</code> statement and
    <code>break</code> statement at
    lines&nbsp;<span class="cross" data-ref="ex6">10 and&nbsp;11</span>.</p>

<div class="example" id="ex6"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 6

def main():
    sum = 0

    # Get ten or fewer numbers from the user and
    # add them together.
    <em>for i in range(10):</em>
        number = float(input("Please enter a number: "))
        if number == 0:
            <em>break</em>
        sum += number

    # Print the sum of the numbers for the user to see.
    print(f"sum: {sum}")


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre>

<pre class="console">&gt; python example_6.py
Please enter a number: 6
Please enter a number: 4
Please enter a number: -2
Please enter a number: 0
sum: 8.0</pre>
</div>

    <h4 id="while">while loop</h4>
    <p>A <code>while</code> loop is more flexible than a
    <code>for</code> loop and repeats while some condition is true.
    Imagine that we need a function to compare the contents of two
    lists. Can we use a loop to compare the contents of two lists?
    Example&nbsp;7 contains a <code>while</code> loop at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex7">lines&nbsp;35&ndash;46</span>
    with an <code>if</code> statement at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex7">line&nbsp;42</span> that finds
    the first index where two lists differ.</p>

<div class="example" id="ex7"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 7

def main():
    list1 = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue"]
    list2 = ["red", "orange", "green", "green", "blue"]

    index = compare_lists(list1, list2)
    if index == -1:
        print("The contents of list1 and list2 are equal")
    else:
        print(f"list1 and list2 differ at index {index}")


def compare_lists(list1, list2):
    """Compare the contents of two lists. If the contents
    of the two lists are not equal, return the index of
    the first difference. If the contents of the two lists
    are equal, return -1.

    Parameters

    # Get the length of the shortest list.
    length1 = len(list1)
    length2 = len(list2)
    limit = min(length1, length2)

    # Begin at the first index (0) and repeat until the
    # computer finds two elements that are not equal or

    <h3 id="compound_list">Compound Lists</h3>
    <p>A <dfn>compound list</dfn> is a list that contains other lists.
    Compound lists are used to store lots of related data.
    Example&nbsp;8 shows how to create a compound list, retrieve one
    inner list from the compound list, and retrieve an individual number
    from the inner list.</p>

    causes the computer to repeat
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex9">lines&nbsp;24&ndash;35</span>
    once for each inner list that is inside the compound list named
    <code>apple_tree_data</code>.

    <h3 id="mutable">Python Lists Are Mutable</h3>
    <p>Python lists are <dfn>mutable</dfn> which means they can be
    changed after they are created. A list can be changed in the
    function where it is created. A list can also be changed inside a
    called function that accepts the list as a parameter. Consider the
    Python program in example&nbsp;10 with two functions named
    <code>main</code> and <code>modify_args</code>. The program in
    example&nbsp;10 does the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><div>The statement at
        <span class="cross" data-ref="ex10">line&nbsp;5</span> assigns
        the value 5 to an integer variable named <var>x</var>.</div></li>

        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="ex10">Line&nbsp;6</span>
        assigns a list to a variable named <var>lx</var>.</div></li>

        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="ex10">Line&nbsp;7 </span>
        prints the values of <var>x</var> and <var>lx</var> before they
        are passed to the <var>modify_args</var> function.</div></li>

        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="ex10">Line&nbsp;11</span>
        calls the <code>modify_args</code> function and passes
        <var>x</var> and <var>lx</var> to that function.</div></li>

        <li><div>Within the <code>modify_args</code> function,
        <span class="cross" data-ref="ex10">line&nbsp;28</span>
        changes the value of the parameter <var>n</var> by adding one (1)
        to it, and <span class="cross" data-ref="ex10">line&nbsp;29</span>
        changes the value of the parameter <var>alist</var> by appending
        the number 4 onto it.</div></li>

        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="ex10">Line&nbsp;13</span>
        prints the values of <var>x</var> and <var>lx</var> after they
        were passed to the <code>modify_args</code> function. Notice in
        the output below that the value of <var>x</var> was not changed
        by the <code>modify_args</code> function. However, the value of
        <var>lx</var> was changed by the <code>modify_args</code>
        function.</div></li>

    <p>From the output of example&nbsp;10, we see that modifying an
    integer parameter changes the integer within the called function
    only. However, modifying a list parameter changes the list within
    the called function and within the calling function.</p>

    <p>Why was the code inside the <code>modify_args</code> function not
    able to change the value in the variable <var>x</var> but was able
    to change the list <var>lx</var>. Because in the Python programming
    language, boolean, integer, float, and string variables are
    <dfn>immutable</dfn>. When the computer executes code that changes a
    boolean, integer, float, or string, the computer actually creates a
    new value and assigns that new value to the variable. For example,
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex10">line&nbsp;28</span> of
    example&nbsp;10 causes the computer to create a new integer value
    that is one (1) larger than the old value and then assign the new
    value to the variable <var>n</var>. However, the computer doesn’t
    assign the new value to the variable <var>x</var> which is in the
    <code>main</code> function. So the variable <var>x</var> still holds
    the old value (5).</p>

    <p>Unlike bools, ints, floats, and strings, Python lists are
    <dfn>mutable</dfn>. When a computer executes code that changes a
    list, the computer doesn’t create a new list but instead changes the
    list by adding, updating, or removing an element from the list. This
    means that the code on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex10">line&nbsp;29</span>
    causes the computer to add another element to <var>alist</var>. But,
    the variables <var>alist</var> in <code>modify_args</code> and
    <var>lx</var> in <code>main</code> refer to the same list. Because
    <var>alist</var> and <var>lx</var> refer to the same list, changing
    <var>alist</var> also changes <var>lx</var>.</p>

    <h2 id="summmary">Summary</h2>
    <p>During this lesson, you are learning how to store many values in
    a list. Each element in a list is stored at a unique index. Each
    index is an integer, and the first index in a Python list is always
    zero (0). The built-in <code>len</code> function will return the
    number of elements stored in a list. The index of the last element
    in a Python list is always one less than the length of the list.
    To retrieve or store one element in a list, you can use the square
    brackets ([&nbsp;and&nbsp;]) and an index. To process all the
    elements in a list, you can write a <code>for</code> loop. A
    compound list is a list that stores smaller lists.</p>

    <p>During this lesson, you are also learning that booleans,
    integers, floats, and strings in Python are immutable and that lists
    in Python are mutable. When a computer executes a line of code that
    appears to change a boolean, integer, float, or string, the computer
    doesn’t actually change the old value of the variable but instead
    creates a new value and assigns the new value to the variable. When
    a computer executes a line of code that adds, updates, or removes an
    element from a list, the computer doesn’t create a new list but
    instead changes the list.</p>
