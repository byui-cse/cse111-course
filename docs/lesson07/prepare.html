    <h1>07 Prepare: Testing Code</h1>
    <p>During this lesson, you will learn to use a more systematic
    approach to developing code. Specifically, you will learn how to
    write test functions that automatically verify that other functions
    are correct. You will learn how to use a Python module named
    <code>pytest</code> to run your test functions, and you will learn
    how to read the output of <code>pytest</code> to help you find and
    fix mistakes in your code.</p>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn this week:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>During previous lessons, you tested your programs by
        running them, typing user input, reading the output, and
        verifying that the output was correct. This is a valid way to
        test a program. However, it is time consuming, tedious, and
        error prone. A much better way to test a program is to test its
        functions individually and to write test functions that
        <em>automatically</em> verify that the program's functions are
        correct.</div></li>

        <li><div><code>pytest</code> is a Python module that makes it
        easy to write and run test functions. During the checkpoint of
        this lesson, you will install and use
        <code>pytest</code>. There are other Python testing modules
        besides pytest, but pytest seems to be the easiest.</div></li>

        <li><div>In this course, you will write your test functions in a
        Python file that is separate from your Python program. In other
        words, you will keep normal program code and test code in
        separate files.</div></li>

        <li><div>To test a function a you should do the following:
        <ol>
            <li><div>Write a function that is part of a normal Python
            program.</div></li>
            <li><div>Think about different parameter values that will
            cause the computer to execute all the code in the program
            function and will possibly cause the program function to
            fail or return an incorrect result.</div></li>
            <li><div>In a separate Python file, write a test function
            that calls the program function and uses an assert statement
            to <em>automatically</em> verify that the value returned
            from the function is correct.</div></li>
            <li><div>Use <code>pytest</code> to run the test
            function.</div></li>
            <li><div>Read the output of pytest and use that output to
            help you find and fix mistakes in both the program function
            and test function.</div></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>Here is a simple function that computes a person's age in
        years.

        get started a programmer first writes a function
        such as this simple function to compute the volume of a cylinder
        that is saved in a file named <code>shapes.py</code>:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">import math

def cylindervolume(radius, height):
    """compute and return the volume of a cylinder."""
    volume = math.pi * radius * radius * height
    return volume
</pre></div>
        </div></li>


        <li><div></div></li>

        <li><div></div></li>

        <li><div></div></li>
    </ol>
