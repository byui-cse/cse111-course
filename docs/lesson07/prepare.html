    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn during this lesson:</p>

    <h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
    <p>Within a Python program, we can store many values in a
    <dfn>list</dfn>. Lists are mutable, meaning they can be changed
    after they are created. Each value in a list is called an
    <dfn>element</dfn> and is stored at a unique index. An
    <dfn>index</dfn> is always an integer and determines where an
    element is stored in a list. The first index of a Python list is
    always zero (0). The following diagram shows a list that contains
    five words. The diagram shows both the elements and the indexes of
    the list. Notice that each index is a unique integer, and that the
    first index is zero.</p>

    <table class="list center"><tbody>
        <tr class="elems"><td class="label">elements</td>
            <td>"yellow"</td> <td>"red"</td> <td>"green"</td>
            <td>"yellow"</td> <td>"blue"</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="label">indexes</td> <td>[0]</td> <td>[1]</td>
            <td>[2]</td> <td>[3]</td> <td>[4]</td></tr>
        <tr><td></td>
            <td colspan="5">&larr; list length is 5 &rarr;</td></tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p>In a Python program, we can create a list by using square
    brackets ([&nbsp;and&nbsp;]). We can determine the number of items
    in a list by using the <code>len</code> function. We can retrieve an
    item from a list and replace an item in a list using square brackets
    ([&nbsp;and&nbsp;]) and an index. Example&nbsp;1 contains a program
    that creates a list, prints the length of the list, retrieves and
    prints one item from the list, changes one item in the list, and
    then prints the entire list.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex1"># Example 1

def main():
    # Create a list that contains five words.
    colors = ["yellow", "red", "green", "yellow", "blue"]

    # Print the length of the list.
    length = len(colors)
    print(length)

    # Print the element that is stored
    # at index 2 in the colors list.
    print(colors[2])

    # Change the element that is stored at
    # index 3 from "yellow" to "purple".
    colors[3] = "purple"

    # Print the entire colors list.
    print(colors)


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console">&gt; python example_1.py
5
green
['yellow', 'red', 'green', 'purple', 'blue']</pre>

    <p>We can add an item to a list by using the <code>insert</code> and
    <code>append</code> methods. We can determine if an element is in a
    list by using the Python membership operator, which is the keyword
    <code>in</code>. We can find the index of an item within a list by
    using the <code>index</code> method. We can remove an item from a
    list by using <code>del</code>, <code>pop</code>, and
    <code>remove</code>. Example&nbsp;2 shows how to create a list and
    add, find, and remove items from a list.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex2"># Example 2

def main():
    # Create an empty list that will hold fabric names.
    fabrics = []

    # Add three elements at the end of the fabrics list.
    fabrics.append("velvet")
    fabrics.append("denim")
    fabrics.append("gingham")

    # Insert an element at the beginning of the fabrics list.
    fabrics.insert(0, "chiffon")

    # Determine if gingham is in the fabrics list.
    if "gingham" in fabrics:
        print("gingham is in the list.")
    else:
        print("gingham is NOT in the list.")

    # Get the index where velvet is stored in the fabrics list.
    i = fabrics.index("velvet")

    # Replace velvet with taffeta.
    fabrics[i] = "taffeta"

    # Remove the last element from the fabrics list.
    fabrics.pop()

    # Remove denim from the fabrics list.
    fabrics.remove("denim")

    # Get the length of the fabrics list and print it.
    n = len(fabrics)
    print(f"The fabrics list contains {n} elements.")


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

    <p>The lists in examples&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;2 store strings. Of course,
    it is possible to store numbers in a list, too. In fact, Python
    allows a programmer to store other data types in a list, including
    other lists.</p>

    <h3 id="compound">Compound Lists</h3>
    <p>A <dfn>compound list</dfn> is a list that contains other lists.
    Compound lists are used to store lots of related data.
    Example&nbsp;3 shows how to create a compound list, retrieve an
    inner list from the compound list, and retrieve an individual number
    from the inner list.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex3"># Example 3

def main():
    # Create a compound list that stores smaller lists.
    apple_tree_data = [
        # [year_planted, height, girth, fruit_amount]
        [2012, 2.7, 3.6, 70.5],
        [2012, 2.4, 3.7, 81.3],
        [2015, 2.3, 3.6, 62.7],
        [2016, 2.1, 2.7, 42.1]
    ]

    # These are the indexes of each
    # element in the inner lists.
    YEAR_PLANTED_INDEX = 0
    HEIGHT_INDEX = 1
    GIRTH_INDEX = 2
    FRUIT_AMOUNT_INDEX = 3

    # Retrieve one inner list from the compound list.
    one_tree = apple_tree_data[2]

    # Retrieve one value from the inner list.
    height = one_tree[HEIGHT_INDEX]

    # Print the tree's height.
    print(height)


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console">&gt; python example_3.py
2.3</pre>

    <h3>Repetition</h3>
    <p>We can cause a computer to repeat a group of statements by
    writing <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops.</p>

    <h4>for</h4>
    <p>A <code>for</code> loop iterates over a range of numbers, such as
    <code>range(3, 10)</code> or a sequence, such as a list. A
    <code>while</code> loop is more flexible than a <code>for</code>
    loop and repeats while some condition is true. Example&nbsp;4 shows
    three <code>for</code> loops that iterate over a range of numbers.
    Notice that just like <code>if</code> statements in Python, the body
    of a loop starts and ends with indentation.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex4"># Example 4

def main():
    # Count from zero to nine by one.
    for i in range(10):
        print(i)

    # Count from zero to eight by two.
    for i in range(0, 10, 2):
        print(i)

    # Count from 100 down to 70 by three.
    for i in range(100, 69, -3):
        print(i)


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

    <h4>break</h4>
    <p>A <code>break</code> statement causes a loop to end early. In
    example&nbsp;5 at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">line&nbsp;8</span>, there is a
    <code>for</code> loop that asks the user to input ten numbers one at
    a time. However, the loop will terminate early if the user enters a
    zero (0) because of the <code>break</code> statement at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">line&nbsp;11</span>. The
    <code>for</code> loop in example&nbsp;5 uses underscore (_) as the
    counting variable, which is a valid variable name in Python. Many
    Python programmers use underscore as the name of the counting
    variable to indicate that the counting variable will not be used
    within the body of the loop.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python" id="ex5"># Example 5

def main():
    sum = 0

    # Get ten or fewer numbers from the user and
    # add them together.
    <em>for _ in range(10):</em>
        number = float(input("Please enter a number: "))
        if number == 0:
            <em>break</em>
        sum += number

    # Print the sum of the numbers for the user to see.
    print(f"sum: {sum}")


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console">&gt; python add_numbers.py
Please enter a number: 6
Please enter a number: 4
Please enter a number: -2
Please enter a number: 0
sum: 8.0</pre>

    <h4>for each</h4>
    <p>In example&nbsp;6 at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex6">line&nbsp;10</span>,
    there is a <code>for</code> loop that processes all the elements in
    a list. The code in the body of the <code>for</code> loop is very
    small and simply prints one element from the list each time through
    the loop. However, we can write as much code as we need in the body
    of a loop to repeatedly perform all sorts of computations for each
    element in the list.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python" id="ex6"># Example 6

def main():
    # Create a list.
    colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue"]

    # Use a for loop to print each element in the list.
    # Of course, the code in the body of a loop can do
    # much more with each element than simply print it.
    <em>for color in colors:
        print(color)</em>


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console">&gt; python print_colors.py
red
orange
yellow
green
blue</pre>

    <h4>while</h4>
    <p>The program in example&nbsp;7 is a number guessing game that
    repeatedly asks the user to guess a number between 1 and 100. At
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex7">line&nbsp;21</span> the program
    includes a <code>while</code> loop, which will cause the computer to
    repeatedly execute the statements at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex7">lines&nbsp;22&ndash;34</span>.
    The while loop will end when the user enters the correct number.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python" id="ex7"># Example 7

import random


def main():
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")
    print("Try to guess it!")
    print()

    # Prepare a string that the input function will show to
    # the user during the first iteration of the while loop.
    prompt = "Please enter an integer between 1 and 100: "

    # Get a random integer between 1 and 100.
    answer = random.randint(1, 100)

    guess = -1
    attempts = 0

    <em>while guess != answer:</em>
        # Get a guess from the user.
        guess = int(input(prompt))
        attempts += 1

        # Compare the user's guess to the answer.
        if guess &lt; answer:
            guide = "low"
        elif guess &gt; answer:
            guide = "high"

        # Prepare a string that the input function will show to
        # the user during the next iteration of the while loop.
        prompt = f"{guess} is too {guide}. Please enter another integer: "

    print()
    print(f"{guess} is correct!")
    print(f"You used {attempts} guesses to guess the number.")


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console">&gt; python number_guess.py
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Try to guess it!

Please enter an integer between 1 and 100: 50
50 is too low. Please enter another integer: 75
75 is too high. Please enter another integer: 62
62 is too high. Please enter another integer: 56

56 is correct!
You used 4 guesses to guess the number.</pre>

    <h3 id="passByRef">Values and References</h3>
    <p>In a Python program, the computer assigns values to variables
    differently based on their data type. Consider the small program in
    example&nbsp;8 and the output of that program:</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python" id="ex8"># Example 8

<span data-scope="global"><span data-scope="main">def main():
    <span class="varDef">x</span> = 17
    <span class="varDef">y</span> = <span class="varUse">x</span>
    print(f"Before changing x: x {<span class="varUse">x</span>}  y {<span class="varUse">y</span>}")
    <span class="varUse">x</span> += 1
    print(f"After changing x:  x {<span class="varUse">x</span>}  y {<span class="varUse">y</span>}")</span>

# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</span></pre></div>

<pre class="console">&gt; python example_8.py
Before changing x: x 17  y 17
After changing x:  <em>x 18  y 17</em></pre>

    <p>The program in example&nbsp;8 contains two integer variables
    named <var>x</var> and <var>y</var>. The program in example&nbsp;8
    does the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>The statement at
        <span class="cross" data-ref="ex8">line&nbsp;4</span>
        stores the value 17 into the variable <var>x</var>.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="ex8">Line&nbsp;5</span>
        copies the value that is in the variable <var>x</var> into the
        variable <var>y</var>.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="ex8">Line&nbsp;6</span>
        prints the values of <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> which are
        both 17.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="ex8">Line&nbsp;7</span>
        adds one to the value of <var>x</var>, making its value 18
        instead of 17.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="ex8">Line&nbsp;8</span>
        prints the values of <var>x</var> and <var>y</var>. The value of
        <var>x</var> was changed to 18. The value of <var>y</var>
        remained unchanged.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Why did <span class="cross" data-ref="ex8">line&nbsp;7</span>
    (<code>x += 1</code>) change the value of <var>x</var> but not
    change the value of <var>y</var>? Because
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex8">line&nbsp;5</span>
    copied <em>the value</em> that was in <var>x</var> into
    <var>y</var>.</p>

    <p>Example&nbsp;9 shows a small Python program that contains two
    variables named <var>lx</var> and <var>ly</var> that each refer to a
    list. This program is similar to the previous program, but it has
    two lists instead of two integers.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python" id="ex9"># Example 9

<span data-scope="global"><span data-scope="main">def main():
    <span class="varDef">lx</span> = [7, -2]
    <span class="varDef">ly</span> = <span class="varUse">lx</span>
    print(f"Before changing lx: lx {<span class="varUse">lx</span>}  ly {<span class="varUse">ly</span>}")
    <span class="varUse">lx</span>.append(5)
    print(f"After changing lx:  lx {<span class="varUse">lx</span>}  ly {<span class="varUse">ly</span>}")</span>

# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</span></pre></div>

<pre class="console">&gt; python example_9.py
Before changing lx: lx [7, -2]  ly [7, -2]
After changing lx:  <em>lx [7, -2, 5]  ly [7, -2, 5]</em></pre>

    <p>From the output of example&nbsp;9, we see there is a big
    difference between the way a Python program assigns integers and the
    way it assigns lists. The program in example&nbsp;9 does the
    following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>The statement at
        <span class="cross" data-ref="ex9">line&nbsp;4</span>
        creates a list and stores a reference to that list in the
        variable <var>lx</var>.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="ex9">Line&nbsp;5</span>
        copies the reference in the variable <var>lx</var> into the
        variable <var>ly</var>. Line&nbsp;5 does not create a copy of
        the list but instead causes both the variables <var>lx</var> and
        <var>ly</var> to refer to the same list.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="ex9">Line&nbsp;6</span>
        prints the values of <var>lx</var> and <var>ly</var>. Notice
        that their values are the same as we expect them to be because
        of line&nbsp;5.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="ex9">Line&nbsp;7</span>
        appends the number 5 onto the list <var>lx</var>.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="ex9">Line&nbsp;8</span>
        prints the values of <var>lx</var> and <var>ly</var> again.
        Notice in the output that when <var>lx</var> and <var>ly</var>
        are printed the second time, it appears that the number 5 was
        appended to both lists.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Why does it appear that appending the number 5 onto <var>lx</var>
    also appended the number 5 onto <var>ly</var>? Because <var>lx</var>
    and <var>ly</var> refer to the same list. There is really only one
    list with two references to that list. Because <var>lx</var> and
    <var>ly</var> refer to the same list, a change to the list through
    variable <var>lx</var> can be seen through variable
    <var>ly</var>.</p>

    <p>From examples&nbsp;8 and&nbsp;9, we learn that when a computer
    executes a Python statement to assign the value of a boolean,
    integer, or float variable to another variable (<code>y = x</code>),
    the computer copies <em>the value</em> of one variable into the
    other. However, when a computer executes a Python statement to
    assign the value of a list variable to another variable
    (<code>ly = lx</code>), the computer does not copy <em>the
    value</em> but instead copies <em>the reference</em> so that both
    variables refer to the same value in memory.</p>

    <p>The fact that the computer copies the value of some data types
    (boolean, integer, float) and copies the reference for other data
    types (list and others) has important implications for passing
    arguments into functions. Consider the Python program in
    example&nbsp;10 with two functions named <code>main</code> and
    <code>modify_args</code>.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>

    # Pass one integer and one list

    modify_args(<span class="varUse">x</span>, <span class="varUse">lx</span>)

    print("   modify_args(n, alist)")

    <p>The program in example&nbsp;10 does the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>The statement at
        <span class="cross" data-ref="ex10">line&nbsp;5</span> assigns
        the value 5 to a variable named <var>x</var>.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="ex10">Line&nbsp;6</span>
        assigns a list to a variable named <var>lx</var>.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="ex10">Line&nbsp;7 </span>
        prints the values of <var>x</var> and <var>lx</var> before they
        are passed to the <var>modify_args</var> function.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="ex10">Line&nbsp;11</span>
        calls the <code>modify_args</code> function and passes
        <var>x</var> and <var>lx</var> to that function.</div></li>
        <li><div>Within the <code>modify_args</code> function,
        <span class="cross" data-ref="ex10">line&nbsp;28</span>
        changes the value of the parameter <var>n</var> by adding one to
        it, and <span class="cross" data-ref="ex10">line&nbsp;29</span>
        changes the value of <var>alist</var> by appending the number 4
        onto it.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="ex10">Line&nbsp;13</span>
        prints the values of <var>x</var> and <var>lx</var> after they
        were passed to the <code>modify_args</code> function. Notice in
        the output below that the value of <var>x</var> was not changed
        by the <code>modify_args</code> function. However, the value of
        <var>lx</var> was changed by the <code>modify_args</code>
        function.</div></li>
    </ul>

<pre class="console">&gt; python example_10.py

    <p>From the output of example&nbsp;10, we see that modifying an
    integer parameter changes the integer within the called function
    only. However, modifying a list parameter changes the list within
    the called function and within the calling function. Why? Because
    when a computer passes a boolean, integer, or float variable to a
    function, the computer copies <em>the value</em> of that variable
    into the parameter of the called function. However, when a computer
    passes a list variable to a function, the computer copies <em>the
    reference</em> so that the original variable and the parameter both
    refer to the same value in memory.</p>

    <h3>Rationale for Pass by Reference</h3>
    <p>Why are lists passed into a function by reference? To understand
    the answer to this question, consider the work a computer would have
    to do if lists were passed by value. When a computer passes a number
    variable to a function, the number is passed by value which means
    the computer copies the value of the number variable into the
    parameter of the called function. This works well for numbers
    because each number variable occupies a small amount of the
    computer's memory. Making a copy of a number is fast, and the copy
    uses a small amount of memory. However, a list may contain millions
    of elements and therefore occupy a large amount of the computer's
    memory. If lists were passed by value into a function, the computer
    would have to make a copy of a list each time it is passed into a
    function. If a list is large, copying the list takes a relatively
    long time and uses a lot of the computer's memory for the copy.
    Therefore, to make programs fast and use less memory, lists (and
    other large data types) are passed into a function by reference.</p>
