    <h1>07 Prepare: Lists and Repetition</h1>
    <p>During this lesson, you will learn about lists and use them in
    Python programs.</p>

    <h2>Videos</h2>
    <p>Watch this video about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beA8IsY3mQs&list=PLlrxD0HtieHhS8VzuMCfQD4uJ9yne1mE6&index=25">lists</a> in Python.</p>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>During this lesson, you should learn how to use lists to store
    many items in a Python program. You should also understand that
    numbers are passed into a function differently than lists are
    passed.</p>

    <h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
    <p>Within a Python program, we can store many elements in a
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists">list</a>.
    Lists are mutable, meaning they can be changed after they are
    created. Each element in a list is stored at a unique index. An
    <dfn>index</dfn> (also known as a <dfn>subscript</dfn>) is always an
    integer and determines where an element is stored in a list. The
    first index of a Python list is always zero (0). The following
    diagram shows a list that contains five words. The diagram shows
    both the elements and the indexes of the list. Notice that each
    index is a unique integer, and that the first index is zero.</p>

    <table class="list center"><tbody>
        <tr class="elems"><td class="label">elements</td>
            <td>"yellow"</td> <td>"red"</td> <td>"green"</td>
            <td>"yellow"</td> <td>"blue"</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="label">indexes</td> <td>[0]</td> <td>[1]</td>
            <td>[2]</td> <td>[3]</td> <td>[4]</td></tr>
        <tr><td></td>
            <td colspan="5">&larr; list length is 5 &rarr;</td></tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p>In a Python program, we can create a list by using square
    brackets ([ and ]). We can determine the number of items in a list
    by using the <code>len</code> function. We can retrieve an item from
    a list and replace an item in a list using square brackets ([ and ])
    and an index. Here is a code example that creates a list, prints the
    length of the list, retrieves and prints one item from the list,
    changes one item in the list, and then prints the entire list.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex1">
# Create a list that contains five words.
colors = ["yellow", "red", "green", "yellow", "blue"]

# Print the length of the list.
length = len(colors)
print(length)

# Print the element that is stored
# at index 2 in the colors list.
print(colors[2])

# Change the element that is stored at
# index 3 from "yellow" to "purple".
colors[3] = "purple"

# Print the entire colors list.
print(colors)</pre></div>

    <p>We can add an item to a list by using the <code>insert</code> and
    <code>append</code> methods. We can determine if an element is in a
    list by using the Python membership operator which is the keyword
    <code>in</code>. We can find the index of an item within a list by
    using the <code>index</code> method. We can remove an item from a
    list by using <code>del</code>, <code>pop</code>, and
    <code>remove</code>. The following code example shows how to create
    a list and add, find, and remove items from a list.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex2">
# Create an empty list that will hold fabric names.
fabrics = []

# Add three elements at the end of the fabrics list.
fabrics.append("velvet")
fabrics.append("denim")
fabrics.append("gingham")

# Insert an element at the beginning of the fabrics list.
fabrics.insert(0, "chiffon")

# Determine if gingham is in the fabrics list.
if "gingham" in fabrics:
    print("gingham is in the list.")
else:
    print("gingham is NOT in the list.")

# Get the index where velvet is stored in the fabrics list.
i = fabrics.index("velvet")

# Replace velvet with taffeta.
fabrics[i] = "taffeta"

# Remove the last element from the fabrics list.
fabrics.pop()

# Remove taffeta from the fabrics list.
fabrics.remove("taffeta")

# Get the length of the fabrics list and print it.
n = len(fabrics)
print(f"The fabrics list contains {n} elements.")

# Use a for loop to print each element in the list. Of
# course, the code in the body of a loop can do much
# more with each element than simply print it.
for element in fabrics:
    print(element)</pre></div>

    <h3>IndexError</h3>
    <p>If we write code that tries to use an index that doesn't exist in
    a list, when the computer executes that code, the computer will
    raise an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndexError"><code>IndexError</code></a>.
    For example, the following example code creates a list that contains
    three surnames. Then the code attempts to print and change the
    surname at index 3. Of course, both of these statements fail because
    the list contains only three elements, and the last index is 2.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex5">
def main():
    try:
        # Create a list that contains three family names.
        surnames = ["Smith", "Lopez", "Marsh"]

        # Attempt to print the surname at index 3. Because there
        # are only three names in the surnames list and therefore
        # the last index is 2, this statement will fail and cause
        # the computer to raise an IndexError.
        print(surnames[3])

        # Attempt to change the surname at index 3. Because there
        # are only three names in the surnames list and therefore
        # the last index is 2, this statement will fail and cause
        # the computer to raise an IndexError.
        surnames[3] = "Olsen"

    except IndexError as index_err:
        print(index_err)


# Call the main function so that
# this program will start executing.
main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console">&gt; python index_error.py
list index out of range</pre>

    <h3>Repetition</h3>
    <p>We can cause a computer to repeat a group of statements by
    writing <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops. A
    <code>for</code> loop iterates over a range of numbers such as
    <code>range(3, 10)</code> or a sequence such as a list. A
    <code>while</code> loop is more flexible than a <code>for</code>
    loop and repeats while some condition is true. The next code example
    shows three loops that iterate over a range of numbers. Notice that
    just like <code>if</code> statements in Python, the body of a loop
    starts and ends with indentation.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex5">
# Count from zero to nine by ones.
for i in range(10):
    print(i)

# Count from zero to eight by twos.
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)

# Count from 100 down to 70 by three.
for i in range(100, 69, -3):
    print(i)</pre></div>

    <p>The next code example contains three loops that iterate over the
    elements in a list, set, and dictionary. The code in the body of
    these example loops is very small and simply prints a value.
    However, we can write as much code as we need in the body of a loop
    to repeatedly perform all manner of complex computations.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex6">
# Create a list.
colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo"]

# Create a set.
names = {"Smith", "Lopez", "Marsh", "Olsen", "Vasiuk"}

# Create a dictionary.
students = {
    "67-412-8350" : "Alan Benson",
    "76-240-1835" : "Madison Silverlake",
    "06-412-7583" : "Samyukta Daniels"
}

# Print each value in a list.
for color in colors:
    print(color)

# Print each value in a set.
for family in names:
    print(family)

# Print each key value pair in a dictionary.
for inumber, name in students.items():
    print(inumber, name)</pre></div>

    <p>A <code>break</code> statement causes a loop to end early. In the
    next code example, there is a <code>for</code> loop that asks the
    user to input ten numbers one at a time. However, the loop will
    terminate early if the user enters a zero (0) because of the
    <code>break</code> statement.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex7">
# Get ten or fewer numbers from the user and add them
# together. Notice that this loop uses underscore (_) as
# the counting variable, which is a valid variable name.
# Many programmers use underscore to indicate that the
# variable will not be used within the body of the loop.
sum = 0
for _ in range(10):
    n = float(input("Please enter a number: "))
    if n == 0:
        <em>break</em>
    sum += n
print(sum)</pre></div>
        </div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="passByRef">Values and References</h3>
    <p>In Python, variables are processed differently based on their
    data type. For example, here is a small Python program that contains
    two integer variables named <var>x</var> and <var>y</var>.</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python" id="ex5">
<span data-scope="global"><span data-scope="main">def main():
    <span class="varDef">x</span> = 17
    <span class="varDef">y</span> = <span class="varUse">x</span>
    print(f"Before changing x: x {<span class="varUse">x</span>}  y {<span class="varUse">y</span>}")
    <span class="varUse">x</span> += 1
    print(f"After changing x:  x {<span class="varUse">x</span>}  y {<span class="varUse">y</span>}")</span>

main()</span></pre></div>

    The previous code will print this:
<pre class="console">&gt; python example1.py
Before changing x: x 17  y 17
After changing x:  <em>x 18  y 17</em></pre>

    Within the previous code:
    <ul>
        <li><div>The statement on
        <span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">line&nbsp;2</span>
        stores the value 17 into the variable <var>x</var>.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">Line&nbsp;3</span>
        copies the value that is in the variable <var>x</var> into the
        variable <var>y</var>.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">Line&nbsp;4</span>
        prints the values of <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> which are
        both 17.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">Line&nbsp;5</span>
        adds one to the value of <var>x</var>, making its value 18
        instead of 17.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">Line&nbsp;6</span>
        prints the values of <var>x</var> and <var>y</var>. The value of
        <var>x</var> was changed to 18. The value of <var>y</var>
        remained unchanged.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Why did <span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">line&nbsp;5</span>
    (<code>x += 1</code>) change the value of <var>x</var> but not
    change the value of <var>y</var>? Because
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">line&nbsp;3</span>
    copied <em>the value</em> that was in <var>x</var> into
    <var>y</var>.</p>

    <p>Here is a small Python program that contains two variables named
    <var>lx</var> and <var>ly</var> that each refer to a list. This
    second program is similar to the first program, but it processes
    lists instead of integers.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python" id="ex6">
<span data-scope="global"><span data-scope="main">def main():
    <span class="varDef">lx</span> = [7, -2]
    <span class="varDef">ly</span> = <span class="varUse">lx</span>
    print(f"Before changing lx: lx {<span class="varUse">lx</span>}  ly {<span class="varUse">ly</span>}")
    <span class="varUse">lx</span>.append(5)
    print(f"After changing lx:  lx {<span class="varUse">lx</span>}  ly {<span class="varUse">ly</span>}")</span>

main()</span></pre></div>

    Here is the output of the second program:

<pre class="console">&gt; python example2.py
Before changing lx: <em>lx [7, -2]</em>  ly [7, -2]
After changing lx:  <em>lx [7, -2, 5]</em>  ly [7, -2, 5]</pre>

    From the output of this second program, we see there is a big
    difference between the way a Python program assigns integers and the
    way it assigns lists. Within the second program:
    <ul>
        <li><div>The statement on
        <span class="cross" data-ref="ex6">line&nbsp;2</span>
        creates a list and stores a reference to that list in the
        variable <var>lx</var>.</div></li>
        <li><div>Line&nbsp;3 copies the reference in the variable
        <var>lx</var> into the variable <var>ly</var>. Line&nbsp;3 does
        not create a copy of the list but instead causes both the
        variables <var>lx</var> and <var>ly</var> to refer to the same
        list.</div></li>
        <li><div>Line&nbsp;4 prints the values of <var>lx</var> and
        <var>ly</var>. Notice that their values are the same as we
        expect them to be because of line&nbsp;3.</div></li>
        <li><div>Line&nbsp;5 appends the number 5 onto the list
        <var>lx</var>.</div></li>
        <li><div>Line&nbsp;6 prints the values of <var>lx</var> and
        <var>ly</var> again. Notice in the output that when
        <var>lx</var> and <var>ly</var> are printed the second time, it
        appears that the number 5 was appended to both lists.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Why does it appear that appending the number 5 onto <var>lx</var>
    also appended the number 5 onto <var>ly</var>? Because <var>lx</var>
    and <var>ly</var> refer to the same list. There is really only one
    list with two references to that list. Because <var>lx</var> and
    <var>ly</var> refer to the same list, a change to the list through
    variable <var>lx</var> can be seen through variable
    <var>ly</var>.</p>

    <p>When a computer executes a Python statement to assign the value
    of a boolean, integer, or float variable to another variable
    (<code>y = x</code>), the computer copies <em>the value</em> of one
    variable into the other. However, when a computer executes a Python
    statement to assign the value of a list variable to another variable
    (<code>ly = lx</code>), the computer does not copy <em>the
    value</em> but instead copies <em>the reference</em> so that both
    variables refer to the same value in memory.</p>

    <p>The fact that the computer copies the value of some data types
    (boolean, integer, float) and copies the reference for other data
    types (list and others) has important implications for passing
    arguments into functions. Consider this Python program with two
    functions named <code>main</code> and <code>modify_args</code>.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python" id="ex7">
<span data-scope="global"><span data-scope="main">def main():
    print("main()")
    <span class="varDef">x</span> = 5
    <span class="varDef">lx</span> = [7, -2]
    print(f"Before calling modify_args(): x {<span class="varUse">x</span>}  lx {<span class="varUse">lx</span>}")

    # Pass one integer and one list
    # to the modify_args function.
    modify_args(<span class="varUse">x</span>, <span class="varUse">lx</span>)

    print(f"After calling modify_args():  x {<span class="varUse">x</span>}  lx {<span class="varUse">lx</span>}")</span>


<span data-scope="modify_args">def modify_args(<span class="varDef">n</span>, <span class="varDef">alist</span>):
    """Demonstrate that the computer passes a value
    for integers and passes a reference for lists.
    Parameters:
        n - A number
        alist - A list
    Return: nothing
    """
    print("   modify_args(n, alist)")
    print(f"   Before changing n and alist: n {<span class="varUse">n</span>}  alist {<span class="varUse">alist</span>}")

    # Change the values of both parameters.
    <span class="varUse">n</span> += 1
    <span class="varUse">alist</span>.append(4)

    print(f"   After changing n and alist:  n {<span class="varUse">n</span>}  alist {<span class="varUse">alist</span>}")</span>


# Call main to begin this program.
main()</span></pre></div>

    Within this third program:
    <ul>
        <li><div>The statement on
        <span class="cross" data-ref="ex7">line&nbsp;3</span> assigns
        the value 5 to a variable named <var>x</var>.</div></li>
        <li><div>Line&nbsp;4 assigns a list to a variable named
        <var>lx</var>.</div></li>
        <li><div>Line&nbsp;5 prints the values of <var>x</var> and
        <var>lx</var> before they are passed to the
        <var>modify_args</var> function.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="ex7">Line&nbsp;9</span>
        calls the <code>modify_args</code> function and passes
        <var>x</var> and <var>lx</var> to that function.</div></li>
        <li><div>Within the <code>modify_args</code> function,
        <span class="cross" data-ref="ex7">line&nbsp;26</span>
        changes the value of the parameter <var>n</var> by adding one to
        it.</div></li>
        <li><div><span class="cross" data-ref="ex7">Line&nbsp;11</span>
        prints the values of <var>x</var> and <var>lx</var> after they
        were passed to the <code>modify_args</code> function. Notice in
        the output below that the value of <var>x</var> was not changed
        by the <code>modify_args</code> function. However, the value of
        <var>lx</var> was changed by the <code>modify_args</code>
        function.</div></li>
    </ul>

<pre class="console">&gt; python example3.py
main()
Before calling modify_args(): x 5  <em>lx [7, -2]</em>
    modify_args(n, alist)
    Before changing n and alist: n 5  alist [7, -2]
    After changing n and alist:  n 6  alist [7, -2, 4]
After calling modify_args():  x 5  <em>lx [7, -2, 4]</em></pre>

    <p>From the output of the third program, we see that modifying an
    integer parameter changes the integer within the called function
    only. However, modifying a list parameter changes the list within
    the called function and within the calling function. Why? Because
    when a computer passes a boolean, integer, or float variable to a
    function, the computer copies <em>the value</em> of that variable
    into the parameter of the called function. However, when a computer
    passes a list variable to a function, the computer copies <em>the
    reference</em> so that the original variable and the parameter both
    refer to the same value in memory.</p>
