    <h1>07 Exercises: Lists and Repetition</h1>
    <p>Here are seven programming exercises that you can use to test and
    improve your skills writing loops in Python. Each exercise includes
    two or more solutions. The last solution is the professionally
    preferred way in Python of solving the task.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Write a loop that prints the integers between zero and
        ten, including zero and ten.

<div class="example" id="exer1">
<pre class="python">
i = 0
while i &lt; 11:
    print(i)
    i += 1

# Print a blank line.
print()

for i in range(11):
    print(i)</pre>

<pre class="console">&gt; python exercise_1.py

&vellip;
10

0

2
&vellip;
10</pre>
</div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Write a loop that prints the integers between three and
        ten, including three and ten.

<div class="example" id="exer2">
<pre class="python">
i = 3
while i &lt; 11:
    print(i)
    i += 1

print()

for i in range(3, 11):

</div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Write a loop that prints the integers 20, 25, 30, 35.

<div class="example" id="exer3">
<pre class="python">
i = 20
while i &lt; 40:
    print(i)
    i += 5

print()

for i in range(20, 40, 5):

        <li><div>Write a loop that prints the integers 40, 38, 36, 34,
        32, 30.

<div class="example" id="exer4">
<pre class="python">
i = 40
while i &gt; 28:
    print(i)
    i -= 2

        <li><div>Write a loop that stores the integers from zero to ten
        in a list. Include zero and ten.

<div class="example" id="exer5">
<pre class="python">
integers = []
i = 0
while i &lt; 11:

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]</pre>
</div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Write a loop that prints each element in a list on a
        different line.

<div class="example" id="exer6">
<pre class="python">
people = ["James", "Lisa", "Juan", "Sophia", "William", "Noah"]

i = 0
while i &lt; len(people):
    person = people[i]

</div>
        </div></li>

        <li><div>Write a loop that prints the elements of two parallel
        lists to a terminal window. In the output, the elements from the
        two lists must be interleaved.

<div class="example" id="exer7">
<pre class="python">
cities = ["Ashton", "Chester", "Drummond", "Felt", "Island Park"]
snowfall = [97, 75, 83, 72, 154]  # inches

    inches = snowfall[i]

    <h2>Other Examples</h2>
    <p>The following examples may help you understand repetition and
    lists better.</p>

    <h3 id="number_guess">Number Guessing Game</h3>
    <p>The program in example&nbsp;1 is a number guessing game that
    repeatedly asks the user to guess a number between 1 and 100. At
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;21</span> the program
    includes a <code>while</code> loop, which will cause the computer to
    repeatedly execute the statements at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">lines&nbsp;22&ndash;35</span>.
    The while loop will end when the user enters the correct number.</p>

<div class="example" id="ex1"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 1

import random


def main():
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")

    # the user during the first iteration of the while loop.
    prompt = "Please enter an integer between 1 and 100: "

    # Get a random integer between 1 and 100.
    answer = random.randint(1, 100)

    print(f"{guess} is correct!")

    <h3 id="prime">Prime Numbers</h3>
    <p>The following program asks a user for a positive integer and then
    prints all the prime integers between 2 and the number entered by
