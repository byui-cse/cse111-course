		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Write a Python program that calls built-in functions and
		standard functions.</p>

		<h2>Project Description</h2>
		<p>In the spring of 2019, several BYU-Idaho students created a
		small Android app to help people learn vocabulary words in a
		foreign language. This app stores the vocabulary words in
		language pairs in a centralized firebase database. Your
		assignment during lessons 3 and 4 is to write a Python program
		that runs on your computer and enables a user to do the
		following:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><div>select a language pair</div></li>
			<li><div>list all of the words stored in the database for
			that language pair</div></li>
			<li><div>find a word and its translation in the language
			pair</div></li>
			<li><div>add a new word and its translation to the language
			pair</div></li>
		</ol>

		<p>During lesson 3, you will write half of this Python program.
		This half will display menus and allow the user to choose
		commands from the menu but will not communicate with the
		firebase database. During lesson 4, you will add the code to
		comminucate with the database.</p>

		<h2>Project Requirements</h2>
		<p>Your program must first allow the user to choose a langange
		pair. Then it must repeatedly show a menu to the user until the
		user chooses "Quit" from the menu. Here is a sample run of the
		program that you will write: (The words shown in
		<span class="input">green</span> are the input that the user
		typed.)</p>

<pre class="console">Please choose a language pair (1 - 4):
[1] ENtoRU
[2] ENtoPT
[3] PTtoEN
[4] PTtoRU
<span class="input">3</span>
PTtoEN

Please choose an action (L, F, A, Q):
[L]ist all words
[F]ind a word
[A]dd a word
[Q]uit
<span class="input">L</span>
List all words

Please choose an action (L, F, A, Q):
[L]ist all words
[F]ind a word
[A]dd a word
[Q]uit
<span class="input">f</span>
Find a word
    Please enter a word: <span class="input">gato</span>

Please choose an action (L, F, A, Q):
[L]ist all words
[F]ind a word
[A]dd a word
[Q]uit
<span class="input">a</span>
Add a word
    Please enter a word: <span class="input">cozinha</span>
    Please enter that word's translation: <span class="input">kitchen</span>

Please choose an action (L, F, A, Q):
[L]ist all words
[F]ind a word
[A]dd a word
[Q]uit
<span class="input">q</span></pre>

		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>At the top of your program, add these two lines of Python
		code. Use the list in these two lines to generate the menu for
		the user to choose a language pair.</p>

<pre class="python"># A simulated list of supported language pairs.
langs = ["ENtoRU", "ENtoPT", "PTtoEN", "PTtoRU"]</pre>

		<p>Within your code, you will call these built-in functions:
		<code>int</code>, <code>input</code>, <code>len</code>,
		<code>print</code>, <code>range</code>, and <code>str</code>.
		Your code will also call these standard string functions
		(methods) <code>.lower</code>, <code>.strip</code>, and
		<code>.upper</code>. In addition, your code will include several
		loops and will use lists.</p>
