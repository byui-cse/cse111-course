    <h1>07 Team Activity: Testing and Fixing Code</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Arrange a one-hour synchronous meeting with your team for this
    activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing meeting.
    Campus students will use class time for this meeting. You should
    prepare for this meeting by completing the preparation material and
    the individual checkpoint assignment beforehand.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Writing and running test functions often helps a software
    developer find mistakes in code. Use test functions and
    <code>pytest</code> to find the mistakes in three previously written
    functions. Then fix those mistakes so that the test functions
    pass.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Download and save this <a download href="names.py">names.py</a>
    Python file and then open it in VS Code. Notice that the downloaded
    file contains three small functions named: <code>full_name</code>,
    <code>given_name</code>, and <code>family_name</code>. Notice also
    that each function has a documentation string that describes what
    the function does. Read the documentation strings for both
    functions.</p>

    <p>The functions in the file that you downloaded
    (<code>names.py</code>) may contain some mistakes. Write a Python
    test program that tests three functions in <code>names.py</code>.
    Use <code>pytest</code> to run the test program and use the output
    from <code>pytest</code> to help you find and fix any mistakes in
    <code>names.py</code>.</p>

    <p>Do the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>At the top of your test program, add this statement to
        import the three functions that are in
        <code>names.py</code>:
        <div class="pre"><pre class="python">from names import given_name, family_name, full_name</pre></div></div></li>

        <li><div>Write a function named <code>test_full_name</code> that
        takes no parameters. Write <code>assert</code> statements inside
        this function to test the value returned from the
        <code>full_name</code> function. If you are not sure what the
        <code>full_name</code> function does or how to test it, read the
        documentation string that is at the top of the
        <code>full_name</code> function in the <code>names.py</code>
        file.</div></li>

        <li><div>Write a function named <code>test_given_name</code>
        that takes no parameters. Write <code>assert</code> statements
        inside this function to test the value returned from the
        <code>given_name</code> function.</div></li>

        <li><div>Write a function named <code>test_family_name</code>
        that takes no parameters. Write <code>assert</code> statements
        inside this function to test the value returned from the
        <code>family_name</code> function.</div></li>

        <li><div>Execute this command in the terminal frame of VS Code
        to run your test program:
        <pre class="console">&gt; python -m pytest &lt;your_python_filename&gt;.py</pre></div></li>

        <li><div>Read the output from <code>pytest</code> and your test
        program. Use the output to help you find and fix any errors that
        are in the <code>full_name</code>, <code>given_name</code>, and
        <code>family_name</code> functions.</div></li>

        <li><div>Repeat steps 5 and 6 until you have found and fixed all
        the mistakes and your tests pass.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Repeat steps 5 and 6 above until you have found and fixed all the
    mistakes in the <code>names.py</code> file and your tests pass.</p>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one-hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
    sample solution. Please <strong>do not look at the sample
    solution</strong> until you have either finished the program or
    diligently worked for at least one hour. At the end of the hour, if
    you are still struggling to complete the assignment, you may use the
    sample solution to help you finish.</p>

    <ul class="links">
        <li>Sample solution:
        <a download href="./teach_solution.py">teach_solution.py</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
