    <h1>07 Team Activity: Testing and Fixing Functions</h1>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Arrange a one hour synchronous meeting with your team for this
    activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing meeting.
    Campus students will use class time for this meeting. You should
    prepare for this meeting by completing the preparation material and
    the individual checkpoint assignment beforehand.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Writing and running test functions often help a software
    developer find mistakes in code.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <p>The <a target="_blank" href="prepare.html">prepare</a> content
    for this lesson explains how to use <code>pytest</code>,
    <code>assert</code>, and <code>approx</code> to automatically verify
    that functions are correct. It also contains an
    <a target="_blank" href="prepare.html#ex">example test function</a>
    and links to additional documentation about <code>pytest</code>.</p>

    <p>This <a href="https://content.byui.edu/items/a9e60503-b5e7-40f0-bf48-ebf1a7441d25/1/example_07.mp4">short video</a>
    shows a BYU-Idaho faculty member writing two test functions and
    using <code>pytest</code> to run them.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Write three test functions that test three previously written
    functions. Use <code>pytest</code> to run the test functions and
    find and fix the mistakes, if any, that are in three previously
    written functions.</p>

    <p>Do the following:</p>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Download the <a download href="names.py">names.py</a>
        Python file and save it in the same folder where you will save
        your Python test program. Then open the downloaded file in VS
        Code. Notice that the downloaded file contains three small
        functions named: <code>full_name</code>,
        <code>given_name</code>, and <code>family_name</code>. Notice
        also that each function has a documentation string that
        describes what the function does. Read the documentation strings
        for all three functions.</div></li>

        <li><div>The functions in the file that you downloaded
        (<code>names.py</code>) may contain some mistakes. Write a
        Python test program named <code>test_names.py</code> that tests
        the three functions in <code>names.py</code>. Save your
        <code>test_names.py</code> file in the same folder where you
        saved the <code>names.py</code> file.</div></li>

        <li><div>At the top of your <code>test_names.py</code> file, add
        these statements to import the three functions that are in
        <code>names.py</code> and to import pytest:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">from names import given_name, family_name, full_name
import pytest</pre></div></div></li>

        <li><div>In <code>test_names.py</code> write a function named
        <code>test_full_name</code> that takes no parameters. Write
        <code>assert</code> statements inside this function to test the
        value returned from the <code>full_name</code> function. If you
        are not sure what the <code>full_name</code> function does or
        how to test it, read the documentation string that is at the top
        of the <code>full_name</code> function in the
        <code>names.py</code> file.</div></li>

        <li><div>In <code>test_names.py</code> write a function named
        <code>test_family_name</code> that takes no parameters. Write
        <code>assert</code> statements inside this function to test the
        value returned from the <code>family_name</code>
        function.</div></li>

        <li><div>In <code>test_names.py</code> write a function named
        <code>test_given_name</code> that takes no parameters. Write
        <code>assert</code> statements inside this function to test the
        value returned from the <code>given_name</code>
        function.</div></li>

        <li><div>At the bottom of your <code>test_names.py</code> file,
        write a call to the <code>pytest.main</code> function like this:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
# Call the main function that is part of pytest so that
# the test functions in this file will start executing.
pytest.main(["-v", "--tb=no", "test_names.py"])
</pre></div></div></li>

        <li><div>Save your <code>test_names.py</code> file and run it by
        clicking the green run icon in VS Code.</div></li>

        <li><div>Read the output from <code>pytest</code> and use the
        output to help you find and fix any errors that are in your test
        functions or the <code>full_name</code>,
        <code>given_name</code>, and <code>family_name</code>
        functions.</div></li>

        <li><div>Repeat steps&nbsp;8 and&nbsp;9 until you have found and
        fixed all the mistakes and your three test functions
        pass.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Write <code>test_full_name</code> so that it tests
        <code>full_name</code> with various names, including long names,
        short names, and hyphenated names.</div></li>
        <li><div>Write <code>test_given_name</code> so that it tests
        <code>given_name</code> with various names, including long
        names, short names, and hyphenated names.</div></li>
        <li><div>Write <code>test_family_name</code> so that it tests
        <code>family_name</code> with various names, including long
        names, short names, and hyphenated names.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an hour,
    complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that the
    stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Fix the mistakes in the <code>full_name</code>
        function.</div></li>
        <li><div>Fix the mistakes in the <code>given_name</code>
        function.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Repeat steps&nbsp;8 and&nbsp;9 above until you have found and
    fixed all the mistakes in the <code>names.py</code> file and your
    tests pass.</p>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
    <a download href="teach_solution.py">sample solution</a>. Please
    <strong>do not look at the sample solution</strong> until you have
    either finished the program or diligently worked for at least one
    hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling to
    complete the assignment, you may use the sample solution to help you
    finish.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
