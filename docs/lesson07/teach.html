	<h1>07 Team Activity: Testing and Fixing Code</h1>

	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>Arrange a one-hour synchronous meeting with your team for this
	activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing meeting.
	Campus students will use class time for this meeting. You should
	prepare for this meeting by completing the preparation material and
	the individual checkpoint assignment beforehand.</p>

	<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
	<p>Use test functions and <code>pytest</code> to find the mistakes
	in other functions. Then fix those mistakes so that the test
	functions pass.</p>

	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<p>Download and save this
	<a download href="names.py">Python file</a> and then open it in VS
	Code. Notice that the downloaded file contains three small functions
	named: <code>full_name</code>, <code>given_name</code>, and
	<code>family_name</code>. Notice also that each function has a
	documentation string that describes what the function does. Read the
	documentation strings for both functions.</p>

	<p>The functions in the file that you downloaded
	(<code>names.py</code>) may contain some mistakes. Write a Python
	test program that tests three functions in <code>names.py</code>.
	Use <code>pytest</code> to run the test program and use the output
	from <code>pytest</code> to help you find and fix any mistakes in
	<code>names.py</code>.</p>

	<p>Do the following:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><div>At the top of your test program, add this statement to
		import the three functions that are in
		<code>names.py</code>:
		<div class="pre"><pre class="python">from names import given_name, family_name, full_name</pre></div></div></li>

		<li><div>Write a function named <code>test_full_name</code> that
		takes no parameters. Write <code>assert</code> statements inside
		this function to test the value returned from the
		<code>full_name</code> function. If you are not sure what the
		<code>full_name</code> function does or how to test it, read the
		documentation string that is at the top of the
		<code>full_name</code> function in the <code>names.py</code>
		file.</div></li>

		<li><div>Write a function named <code>test_given_name</code>
		that takes no parameters. Write <code>assert</code> statements
		inside this function to test the value returned from the
		<code>given_name</code> function.</div></li>

		<li><div>Write a function named <code>test_family_name</code>
		that takes no parameters. Write <code>assert</code> statements
		inside this function to test the value returned from the
		<code>family_name</code> function.</div></li>

		<li><div>Execute this command in the terminal frame of VS Code
		to run your test program:
		<pre class="console">&gt; python -m pytest &lt;your_python_filename&gt;.py</pre></div></li>

		<li><div>Read the output from <code>pytest</code> and your test
		program. Use the output to help you find and fix any errors that
		are in the <code>full_name</code>, <code>given_name</code>, and
		<code>family_name</code> functions.</div></li>

		<li><div>Repeat steps 5 and 6 until you have found and fixed all
		the mistakes and your tests pass.</div></li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Sample Solution</h2>
	<p>Please work diligently with your team for the one-hour meeting.
	After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
	sample solution. Please <strong>do not look at the sample
	solution</strong> until you have either finished the program or
	diligently worked for at least one hour. At the end of the hour, if
	you are still struggling to complete the assignment, you may use the
	sample solution to help you finish.</p>

	<ul class="links">
		<li>Sample solution:
		<a target="_blank" download
		href="./teach_solution.py">teach_solution.py</a></li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Submission</h2>
	<p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
	via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
	requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
	during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
	with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
	on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
	completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
