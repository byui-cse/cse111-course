    <h1>07 Team Activity: Testing and Fixing Code</h1>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Arrange a one hour synchronous meeting with your team for this
    activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing meeting.
    Campus students will use class time for this meeting. You should
    prepare for this meeting by completing the preparation material and
    the individual checkpoint assignment beforehand.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Writing and running test functions often helps a software
    developer find mistakes in code.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Write three test functions that test three previously written
    functions. Use <code>pytest</code> to run the test functions and
    find and fix the mistakes, if any, that are in three previously
    written functions. Do the following:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Download this Python file: <a download
        href="names.py">names.py</a> and save it in the same folder
        where you will save your Python test program. Then open the
        downloaded file in VS Code. Notice that the downloaded file
        contains three small functions named: <code>full_name</code>,
        <code>given_name</code>, and <code>family_name</code>. Notice also
        that each function has a documentation string that describes what
        the function does. Read the documentation strings for all three
        functions.</div></li>

        <li><div>The functions in the file that you downloaded
        (<code>names.py</code>) may contain some mistakes. Write a
        Python test program named <code>test_names.py</code> that tests
        the three functions in <code>names.py</code>. Save your
        <code>test_names.py</code> file in the same folder where you
        saved the <code>names.py</code> file.</div></li>

        <li><div>At the top of your <code>test_names.py</code> file, add
        this statement to import the three functions that are in
        <code>names.py</code>:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">from names import given_name, family_name, full_name</pre></div></div></li>

        <li><div>In <code>test_names.py</code> write a function named
        <code>test_full_name</code> that takes no parameters. Write
        <code>assert</code> statements inside this function to test the
        value returned from the <code>full_name</code> function. If you
        are not sure what the <code>full_name</code> function does or
        how to test it, read the documentation string that is at the top
        of the <code>full_name</code> function in the
        <code>names.py</code> file.</div></li>

        <li><div>In <code>test_names.py</code> write a function named
        <code>test_given_name</code> that takes no parameters. Write
        <code>assert</code> statements inside this function to test the
        value returned from the <code>given_name</code>
        function.</div></li>

        <li><div>In <code>test_names.py</code> write a function named
        <code>test_family_name</code> that takes no parameters. Write
        <code>assert</code> statements inside this function to test the
        value returned from the <code>family_name</code>
        function.</div></li>

        <li><div>Execute this command in the terminal frame of VS Code
        to run your test program:
<pre class="console">&gt; python -m pytest test_names.py</pre></div></li>

        <li><div>Read the output from <code>pytest</code> and use the
        output to help you find and fix any errors that are in your test
        functions or the <code>full_name</code>,
        <code>given_name</code>, and <code>family_name</code>
        functions.</div></li>

        <li><div>Repeat steps 5 and 6 until you have found and fixed all
        the mistakes and your three test functions pass.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Write <code>test_full_name</code> so that it tests
        <code>full_name</code> with various names, including long names,
        short names, and hyphenated names.</div></li>
        <li><div>Write <code>test_given_name</code> so that it tests
        <code>given_name</code> with various names, including long
        names, short names, and hyphenated names.</div></li>
        <li><div>Write <code>test_family_name</code> so that it tests
        <code>family_name</code> with various names, including long
        names, short names, and hyphenated names.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Fix the mistakes in the <code>full_name</code>
        function.</div></li>
        <li><div>Fix the mistakes in the <code>given_name</code>
        function.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Repeat steps 5 and 6 above until you have found and fixed all the
    mistakes in the <code>names.py</code> file and your tests pass.</p>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
    <a download href="teach_solution.py">sample solution</a>. Please
    <strong>do not look at the sample solution</strong> until you have
    either finished the program or diligently worked for at least one
    hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling to
    complete the assignment, you may use the sample solution to help you
    finish.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
