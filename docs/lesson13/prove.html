    <h1>13 Prove Assignment: Significant Python Program</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a significant Python program that uses
    real world data and solves a real world problem. Your program must
    include multiple functions that you verify are correct with test
    functions and <code>pytest</code>.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Finish developing the program that you started in the
    <a href="../lesson11/prove.html">prove assignment</a> for
    lesson&nbsp;11.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>At the end of this lesson, you must complete this lesson's Prove:
    Assignment quiz in I-Learn. Your teacher or teaching assistant will
    grade your work according to this rubric:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Time - 50%: Did you spend at least six hours (including
        class time for face-to-face students) on your program during the
        current lesson?</div></li>

        <li><div>Description - 10%: Is the description of your work
        complete and easily understandable? At the end of each lesson,
        you will submit a description of your work. This description
        should follow normal English rules of spelling and grammar. It
        must include the following:
        <ol>
            <li><div>The amount of time that you spent working on your
            program during the current lesson.</div></li>
            <li><div>A list of the function names in your program.</div></li>
            <li><div>A list of the test function names in your
            test code.</div></li>
            <li><div>A list of the documentation that you read, the
            videos that you watched, and the coding experiments that you
            tried.</div></li>
            <li><div>A list of the work that you finished on your
            program.</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>

        <li><div>Program - 24%
        <ol>
            <li><div>Is your program divided into functions and does each
            function perform one task only?
            <ul>
                <li><div>Some attempt made - 1 point</div></li>
                <li><div>Developing but significantly deficient - 2 points</div></li>
                <li><div>Slightly deficient - 3 points</div></li>
                <li><div>Meets expectations - 4 points</div></li>
            </ul></div></li>
            <li><div>Does your program effectively uses existing Python
            modules such as math, random, requests, pandas, and tkinter?
            <ul>
                <li><div>Some attempt made - 1 point</div></li>
                <li><div>Developing but significantly deficient - 2 points</div></li>
                <li><div>Slightly deficient - 3 points</div></li>
                <li><div>Meets expectations - 4 points</div></li>
            </ul></div></li>
            <li><div>Does your program perform a significant real world
            task?
            <ul>
                <li><div>Some attempt made - 1 point</div></li>
                <li><div>Developing but significantly deficient - 2 points</div></li>
                <li><div>Slightly deficient - 3 points</div></li>
                <li><div>Meets expectations - 4 points</div></li>
            </ul></div></li>
        </ol></div></li>

        <li><div>Test Functions - 16%
        <ol>
            <li><div>Each testable program function is covered (tested)
            by one test function. (Some functions, especially
            <code>main</code> and those that create GUIs are difficult
            to test and don't need to have a corresponding test function.)
            <ul>
                <li><div>Some attempt made - 1 point</div></li>
                <li><div>Developing but significantly deficient - 2 points</div></li>
                <li><div>Slightly deficient - 3 points</div></li>
                <li><div>Meets expectations - 4 points</div></li>
            </ul></div></li>
            <li><div>Each test function completely exercises (tests) its
            corresponding program function. In other words, the test
            function calls the program function multiple times with
            different arguments, including unusual or unexpected
            values.
            <ul>
                <li><div>Some attempt made - 1 point</div></li>
                <li><div>Developing but significantly deficient - 2 points</div></li>
                <li><div>Slightly deficient - 3 points</div></li>
                <li><div>Meets expectations - 4 points</div></li>
            </ul></div></li>
        </ol></div></li>
