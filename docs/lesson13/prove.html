    <h1>13 Prove Assignment: Significant Python Program</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a significant Python program that uses
    real-world data and solves a real world problem. Your program must
    include multiple functions that you verify are correct with test
    functions and <code>pytest</code>.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Finish developing the program that you started in the
    <a href="../lesson11/prove.html">prove assignment</a> for
    lesson&nbsp;11.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>At the end of this lesson, you must complete this lesson's Prove:
    Assignment quiz in I-Learn. Your teacher or teaching assistant will
    grade your work according to this rubric:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Time&mdash;50%: Did you spend at least six hours
        (including class time for face-to-face students) on your program
        during the current lesson?</div></li>

        <li><div>Description&mdash;10%: Is the description of your work
        complete and easily understandable? At the end of each lesson,
        you will submit a description of your work. This description
        should follow normal English rules of spelling and grammar. It
        must include the following:
        <ol>
            <li><div>The amount of time that you spent working on your
            program during the current lesson.</div></li>
            <li><div>A list of the function names in your program.</div></li>
            <li><div>A list of the test function names in your
            test code.</div></li>
            <li><div>A list of the documentation that you read, the
            videos that you watched, and the coding experiments that you
            tried.</div></li>
            <li><div>A list of the work that you finished on your
            program.</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>

        <li><div>Program&mdash;24%
        <ol>
            <li><div>Is your program divided into functions and does each
            function perform one task only?</div></li>
            <li><div>Does your program effectively use existing Python
            modules such as math, random, requests, pandas, and
            tkinter?</div></li>
            <li><div>Does your program perform a significant real-world
            task?</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>

        <li><div>Test Functions&mdash;16%
        <ol>
            <li><div>Is each testable program function covered (tested)
            by one test function. (Some functions, especially
            <code>main</code> and those that create GUIs are difficult
            to test and don't need to have a corresponding test
            function.)</div></li>
            <li><div>Does each test function completely exercise (test)
            its corresponding program function. In other words, does the
            test function call the program function multiple times with
            different arguments, including unusual or unexpected
            values.</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>
