    <p>In this lesson, you will learn how to store data in and retrieve
    data from Python dictionaries. You will also learn how to write a
    loop that processes all the items in a dictionary.</p>

    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn during this lesson:</p>

    <section>
    <h3 id="dicts">Dictionaries</h3>
    <p>A Python program can store many items in a <dfn>dictionary</dfn>.
    Each <dfn>item</dfn> in a dictionary is a key value pair. Each
    <dfn>key</dfn> within a dictionary must be unique. In other words,
    no key can appear more than once in a dictionary. Values within a
    dictionary do not have to be unique. Dictionaries are mutable,
    meaning they can be changed after they are created. Dictionaries
    were invented to enable computers to find items quickly.</p>

    <p>The following table represents a dictionary that contains five
    items (five key value pairs) Notice that each of the keys is
    unique.</p>

    <table class="center"><thead>
        <tr><th colspan="2">items</th> <th></th></tr>
        <tr><th>keys</th> <th>values</th> <th></th></tr>
    </thead><tbody>
        <tr><td>42-039-4736</td> <td>Clint Huish</td>
            <td class="center">↑</td></tr>
        <tr><td>61-315-0160</td> <td>Amelia Davis</td>
            <td class="center">|</td></tr>
        <tr><td>10-450-1203</td> <td>Ana Soares</td>
            <td class="center">5 items</td></tr>
        <tr><td>75-421-2310</td> <td>Abdul Ali</td>
            <td class="center">|</td></tr>
        <tr><td>07-103-5621</td> <td>Amelia Davis</td>
            <td class="center">↓</td></tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p>We can create a dictionary by using curly braces
    ({&nbsp;and&nbsp;}). We can add an item to a dictionary and find an
    item in a dictionary by using square brackets ([&nbsp;and&nbsp;])
    and a key. The following code example shows how to create a
    dictionary, add an item, remove an item, and find an item in a
    dictionary.</p>

    <div class="example" id="ex1"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 1

def main():
    # Create a dictionary with student IDs as
    # the keys and student names as the values.
    students_dict = {
        "42-039-4736": "Clint Huish",
        "61-315-0160": "Amelia Davis",
        "10-450-1203": "Ana Soares",
        "75-421-2310": "Abdul Ali",
        "07-103-5621": "Amelia Davis"
    }

    # Add an item to the dictionary.
    <em>students_dict["81-298-9238"] = "Sama Patel"</em>

    # Remove an item from the dictionary.
    students_dict.pop("61-315-0160")

    # Get the number of items in the dictionary.
    length = len(students_dict)
    print(f"length: {length}")

    # Print the entire dictionary.
    print(students_dict)
    print()

    # Get a student ID from the user.
    id = input("Enter a student ID: ")

    # Check if the student ID is in the dictionary.
    if id in students_dict:

        # Find the student ID in the dictionary and
        # retrieve the corresponding student name.
        <em>name = students_dict[id]</em>

        # Print the student's name.
        print(name)

    else:
        print("No such student")


# Call main to start this program.

    </div>

    <p><span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">Line&nbsp;15</span> in the
    previous code example, adds an item to the dictionary. To add an
    item to an existing dictionary, write code that follows this
    template:</p>
<div class="example"><pre class="python">
    <var>dictionary_name</var>[<var>key</var>] = <var>value</var>
</pre></div>
    <p>Notice that <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;15</span>
    follows this template.</p>

    <p><span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">Line&nbsp;32</span> in the
    previous code example, uses the Python membership operator, which is
    the keyword <code>in</code>, to check if a key is stored in a
    dictionary. To check if a key is stored in a dictionary, write code
    that follows this template:</p>
<div class="example"><pre class="python">
    if <var>key</var> in <var>dictionary_name</var>:
</pre></div>
    <p>Notice that <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;32</span>
    follows this template.</p>

    <p><span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">Line&nbsp;36</span> in the
    previous code example, finds a key and retrieves its corresponding
    value from a dictionary. To find a key and retrieve its
    corresponding value, write code that follows this template:</p>
<div class="example"><pre class="python">
    <var>value</var> = <var>dictionary_name</var>[<var>key</var>]
</pre></div>

    follows this template.</p>

    <h3 id="compound_vals">Compound Values</h3>
    <p>A <dfn>simple value</dfn> is a value that doesn’t contain parts,
    such as an integer or a string. A <dfn>compound value</dfn> is a
    value that has parts, such as a list. In example&nbsp;1,
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">lines&nbsp;6&ndash;12</span>
    above, the students dictionary has simple keys and values. Each key
    is a single string, and each value is a single string. It is
    possible to store compound values in a dictionary. Example&nbsp;2
    shows a students dictionary where each value is a Python list.
    Because each list contains multiple parts, we say that the
    dictionary stores compound values.</p>

<div class="example" id="ex2"><pre class="python"># Example 2

def main():
    # Create a dictionary with student IDs as the keys
    # and student data stored in a list as the values.
    students_dict = {
        # student_ID: [given_name, surname, email_address, credits]
        "42-039-4736": ["Clint", "Huish", "hui20001@byui.edu", 16],
        "61-315-0160": ["Amelia", "Davis", "dav21012@byui.edu", 3],
        "10-450-1203": ["Ana", "Soares", "soa22005@byui.edu", 15],
        "75-421-2310": ["Abdul", "Ali", "ali20003@byui.edu", 5],
        "07-103-5621": ["Amelia", "Davis" "dav19008@byui.edu", 0]
    }

</pre></div>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h3 id="find_one">Finding One Item</h3>
    <p>The reason Python dictionaries were developed is to make finding
    items easy and fast. As explained in example&nbsp;1, to find an item
    in a dictionary, a programmer needs to write just one line of code
    that follows this template:</p>

<div class="example"><pre class="python">
    <var>value</var> = <var>dictionary_name</var>[<var>key</var>]
</pre></div>

    <p>That one line of code will cause the computer to search the
    dictionary until it finds the <var>key</var>. Then the computer will
    return the <var>value</var> that corresponds to the <var>key</var>.
    Some programmers forget how easy it is to find items in a
    dictionary, and when asked to write code to find an item, they write
    complex code like
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex3">lines&nbsp;24&ndash;28</span>
    in example&nbsp;3.</p>

<div class="example" id="ex3"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 3

def main():
    # Create a dictionary with student IDs as the keys
    # and student data stored in a list as the values.
    students_dict = {
        # student_ID: [given_name, surname, email_address, credits]
        "42-039-4736": ["Clint", "Huish", "hui20001@byui.edu", 16],
        "61-315-0160": ["Amelia", "Davis", "dav21012@byui.edu", 3],
        "10-450-1203": ["Ana", "Soares", "soa22005@byui.edu", 15],
        "75-421-2310": ["Abdul", "Ali", "ali20003@byui.edu", 5],
        "07-103-5621": ["Amelia", "Davis" "dav19008@byui.edu", 0]
    }

    # Get a student ID from the user.
    id = input("Enter a student ID: ")

    <em># This is a difficult and slow way to find an item in a
    # dictionary. Don't write code like this to find an item
    # in a dictionary!</em>

    # For each item in the dictionary, check if
    # its key is the same as the variable id.
    student = None
    for key, value in students_dict.items(): <em># Bad example!</em>
        if key == id:                        <em># Don't use a loop</em>
            student = value                  <em># like this to find an</em>
            break                            <em># item in a dictionary.</em></pre></div>

    <p>Compare the <code>for</code> loop at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex3">lines&nbsp;24&ndash;28</span> in
    the previous example to this one line of code.</p>
<div class="example"><pre class="python">
    value = students_dict[id]
</pre></div>

    <p>Clearly, writing one line of code is easier for a programmer than
    writing the <code>for</code> loop. Not only is the one line of code
    easier to write, but the computer will execute it much, much faster
    than the <code>for</code> loop. Therefore, when you need to write
    code to find an item in a dictionary, don’t write a loop. Instead,
    write one line of code that uses the square brackets
    ([&nbsp;and&nbsp;]) and a key to find an item. Example&nbsp;4,
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex4">line&nbsp;29</span> shows
    the correct way to find an item in a dictionary.</p>

<div class="example" id="ex4"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 4

def main():
    # Create a dictionary with student IDs as the keys
    # and student data stored in a list as the values.

    # Check if the student ID is in the dictionary.
    if id in students_dict:

        # Find the student ID in the dictionary and
        # retrieve the corresponding value, which is a list.
        value = students_dict[id]

        surname = value[SURNAME_INDEX]

    <h3 id="process_all">Processing All Items</h3>
    <p>Occasionally, you may need to write a program that processes all
    the items in a dictionary. Processing all the items in a dictionary
    is different than finding one item in a dictionary. Processing all
    the items is done using a <code>for</code> loop and the
    <code>dict.items()</code> method as shown in example&nbsp;5 on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">line&nbsp;26</span>.</p>

<div class="example" id="ex5"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 5

def main():
    # Create a dictionary with student IDs as the keys
    # and student data stored in a list as the values.

        key = item[0]
        value = item[1]

        # Retrieve the number of credits from the value list.

    <p>As with all the example code in CSE&nbsp;111, example&nbsp;5
    contains working Python code. Even though the code works, we can
    combine <span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">lines&nbsp;26&ndash;28</span>
    into a single line of code by using a Python shortcut called
    <dfn>unpacking</dfn>. Instead of writing lines&nbsp;26&ndash;28,
    like this:</p>

<div class="example"><pre class="python">
    for item in students_dict.items():
        key = item[0]
        value = item[1]
</pre></div>

    <p>We can write one line of code that combines the three lines of
    code and unpacks the item in the <code>for</code> statement like
    this:</p>

<div class="example"><pre class="python">
    for key, value in students_dict.items():
</pre></div>

    <p>Example&nbsp;6 contains the same code as example&nbsp;5 except
    example&nbsp;6 uses the Python unpacking shortcut at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex6">line&nbsp;26</span>.</p>

    <h3 id="lists_to_dict">Converting between Lists and Dictionaries</h3>
    <p>It is possible to convert two lists into a dictionary by using
    the built-in <code>zip</code> and <code>dict</code> functions. The
    contents of the first list will become the keys in the dictionary,
    and the contents of the second list will become the values. This
    implies that the two lists must have the same length, and the
    elements in the first list must be unique because keys in a
    dictionary must be unique.</p>

    <p>It is also possible to convert a dictionary into two lists by
    using the <code>keys</code> and <code>values</code> methods and the
    built-in <code>list</code> function. The following code example
    starts with two lists, converts them into a dictionary, and then
    converts the dictionary into two lists.</p>

    <h2 id="dict_apps">More Examples</h2>
    <p>Dictionaries are an important programming tool that you can use
    to use to solve different types of computing problems. You can use
    dictionaries to find things very fast, to count many things, and to
    group things.</p>

    <section>
    <h3 id="find">Finding</h3>
    <p>The reason Python dictionaries were developed is to make finding
    items easy and fast. Each item in a dictionary is a key value pair.
    The Python language imposes some restrictions on the keys, including
    the restriction that each key within a dictionary must be unique.
    Python imposes very few restrictions on the values in a dictionary.
    This means we can store almost any Python object as a value in a
    dictionary, and we can use that dictionary to easily and quickly
    find the value.</p>

    <p>Consider the program in example&nbsp;8 which stores Python
    functions as values in a dictionary. At
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex8">lines&nbsp;41&ndash;54</span>,
    the program contains five functions that each perform a different
    task. Each of the five functions is stored as a value in a
    dictionary on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex8">lines&nbsp;4&ndash;10</span>.
    When a user runs the program, the code on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex8">lines&nbsp;15&ndash;21</span>
    causes the program to print a small menu of possible tasks.
    Then the user chooses one of the tasks for the program to execute.
    Then at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex8">lines&nbsp;25 and&nbsp;28</span>,
    the program finds the user choice in the tasks dictionary and at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex8">line&nbsp;33</span>, calls the
    correct function to complete the task.</p>

    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>A dictionary in a Python program can store many pieces of data
    called items. An item is a key value pair. Each key that is stored
    in a dictionary must be unique. Values do not have to be unique. To
    create a dictionary, we use curly braces ({&nbsp;and&nbsp;}). To add
    an item and find an item in a dictionary, we use the square brackets
    ([&nbsp;and&nbsp;]) and a key. To process all items in a dictionary,
    we write a <code>for</code> each loop. Dictionaries were invented to
    enable a computer to find items very quickly. Do not write a for
    each loop to find an item in a dictionary. To find an item in a
    dictionary, use square brackets ([&nbsp;and&nbsp;]) and a key.</p>
