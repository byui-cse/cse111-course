    <h1>08 Prepare: Handling Errors</h1>
    <p>Errors and exceptional situations sometimes occur while a program
    is running. Such errors include a file that does not exist, a
    connection error from trying to connect to a server, data that
    cannot be found on a server, and calculations that produce undefined
    results. A well written program handles errors in a graceful manner
    that may include adjusting to an error, printing an error message
    for the user to see, and saving an error to a log file. During this
    lesson, you will learn to write code that handles errors that may
    occur while your Python program is running.</p>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn during this lesson.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>An exception is a relatively rare exceptional event
        that sometimes occurs while a Python program is running. In
        Python, an error is a type of exception. There are many
        different <a target="_blank"
        href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html">built-in
        exceptions</a> that may occur while a Python program is
        running.</div></li>

        <li><div>When an exceptional event occurs, a Python function
        raises an exception which may be handled by code at another
        location in the executing Python program. The Python keyword to
        raise an exception is <code>raise</code>.</div></li>

        <li><div>The Python keywords to handle exceptions are
        <code>try</code>, <code>except</code>, <code>else</code>, and
        <code>finally</code>. The following example code contains the
        outline of a complete try-except-else-finally block. Read the
        code and its comments carefully to understand the correct syntax
        and organization of a try-except-else-finally block.

<div class="pre"><pre class="python"><em>try</em>:
    # Write normal code here. This block must include
    # code that falls into two groups:
    # 1. Code that may cause an exception to be raised
    # 2. Code that depends on the results from the code
    #    in the first group
<em>except ZeroDivisionError as ex:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in the
    # try block caused a ZeroDivisionError to be raised.
<em>except OSError as ex:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in
    # the try block caused an OSError to be raised.
<em>except ValueError as ex:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in
    # the try block caused a ValueError to be raised.
<em>except (TypeError, KeyError, NameError) as ex:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in the try
    # block raised a TypeError, KeyError, or NameError.
<em>except Exception as ex:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in the
    # try block caused any exception to be raised that was
    # not handled by one of the previous except blocks.
<em>except:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in the
    # try block caused anything to be raised that was
    # not handled by one of the previous except blocks.
<em>else:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes after the code
    # in the try block if the code in the try block
    # did not raise any exceptions.
<em>finally:</em>
    # Code that is executed after all the other code in
    # try, except, and else blocks regardless of whether
    # an exception was raised or not.</pre></div></div></li>

        <li><div>As shown in the example code above, when we want to
        write code that will handle exceptions, we first write a
        <code>try</code> block, and we put into that <code>try</code>
        block the normal code that might cause an exception.
        Then we write <code>except</code> blocks to handle the
        exceptions. Each <code>except</code> block may handle one type
        of exception such as:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">except ValueError as ex:</pre></div>
        Or each <code>except</code> block may handle several types of
        exceptions, such as:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">except (TypeError, KeyError, NameError) as ex:</pre></div>
Or one <code>except</code> block may handle all possible types of
exceptions such as:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">except Exception as ex:</pre></div>
Or a bare <code>except</code> block may handle anything that can
be raised, including <code>SystemExit</code>,
<code>KeyboardInterrupt</code> and <code>GeneratorExit</code>
such as:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">except:</pre></div>
We must order except blocks from most specific at the top to
        least specific (most general) at the bottom.</div></li>

        <li><div>As shown in the example code above, following the
        <code>except</code> blocks, we may write an optional
        <code>else</code> block which the computer will execute if the
        <code>try</code> block does not raise any exceptions. It is
        uncommon to need to write code in the <code>else</code> block of
        <code>try</code> and <code>except</code>, and professional
        programmers almost never do it.</div></li>

        <li><div>As shown in the example code above, at the end of the
        exception handling code, we may write an optional
        <code>finally</code> block. The <code>finally</code> block
        contains code that the computer executes after all the other
        code in the <code>try</code>, <code>except</code>, and
        <code>else</code> blocks regardless of whether an exception was
        raised or not. The code in the <code>finally</code> block
        usually contains "clean up" code that frees resources that the
        code in the <code>try</code> block used. For example, if the
        code in the <code>try</code> block opens a file, the code in the
        <code>finally</code> block could close that file.</div></li>
