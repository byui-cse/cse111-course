    <h1>08 Prepare: Handling Errors</h1>
    <p>Errors and exceptional situations sometimes occur while a program
    is running. Such errors include a file that does not exist, a
    connection error from trying to connect to a server, data that
    cannot be found on a server, and calculations that produce undefined
    results. A well written program handles errors in a graceful manner
    that may include adjusting to an error, printing an error message
    for the user to see, and saving an error message to a log file.
    During this lesson, you will learn to write code that handles errors
    that may occur while your Python program is running.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn during this lesson.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>An <dfn>exception</dfn> is a relatively rare event that
        sometimes occurs while a Python program is running. For example,
        an exception occurs when a Python program tries to open a file
        for reading, and that file doesn't exist. There are many different
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html">built-in
        exceptions</a> that may occur while a Python program is
        running.</div></li>

        <li><div>When an exceptional event occurs, a Python function
        <dfn>raises</dfn> an exception which may be handled by code at
        another location in the executing Python program. The Python
        keyword to raise an exception is <code>raise</code>.</div></li>

        <li><div>The Python keywords to handle exceptions are
        <code>try</code>, <code>except</code>, <code>else</code>, and
        <code>finally</code>. The following example code contains the
        outline of a complete try-except-else-finally block. Read the
        code and its comments carefully to understand the correct syntax
        and organization of a try-except-else-finally block.

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex1">
<em>try</em>:
    # Write normal code here. This block must include
    # code that falls into two groups:
    # 1. Code that may cause an exception to be raised
    # 2. Code that depends on the results from the code
    #    in the first group
<em>except ZeroDivisionError as ex:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in the
    # try block caused a ZeroDivisionError to be raised.
<em>except ValueError as ex:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in
    # the try block caused a ValueError to be raised.
<em>except (TypeError, KeyError, NameError) as ex:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in the try
    # block raised a TypeError, KeyError, or NameError.
<em>except Exception as ex:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in the
    # try block caused any exception to be raised that was
    # not handled by one of the previous except blocks.
<em>except:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in the
    # try block caused anything to be raised that was
    # not handled by one of the previous except blocks.
<em>else:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes after the code
    # in the try block if the code in the try block
    # did not raise any exceptions.
<em>finally:</em>
    # Code that is executed after all the other code in
    # try, except, and else blocks regardless of whether
    # an exception was raised or not.</pre></div></div></li>

        <li><div>As shown in the example code above, when we want to
        write code that will handle exceptions, we first write a
        <code>try</code> block, and we put into that <code>try</code>
        block the normal code that might cause an exception.
        Then we write <code>except</code> blocks to handle the
        exceptions. Each <code>except</code> block may handle one type
        of exception such as:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">except ValueError as ex:</pre></div>
        Or each <code>except</code> block may handle several types of
        exceptions, such as:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">except (TypeError, KeyError, NameError) as ex:</pre></div>
Or one <code>except</code> block may handle all possible types of
exceptions such as:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">except Exception as ex:</pre></div>
Or a bare <code>except</code> block may handle anything that can
be raised, including <code>SystemExit</code>,
<code>KeyboardInterrupt</code> and <code>GeneratorExit</code>
such as:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">except:</pre></div>
We must order except blocks from most specific at the top to
        least specific (most general) at the bottom.</div></li>

        <li><div>As shown in the example code above, following the
        <code>except</code> blocks, we may write an optional
        <code>else</code> block which the computer will execute if the
        <code>try</code> block does not raise any exceptions. It is
        uncommon to need to write code in the <code>else</code> block of
        <code>try</code> and <code>except</code>, and professional
        programmers almost never do it.</div></li>

        <li><div>As shown in the example code above, at the end of the
        exception handling code, we may write an optional
        <code>finally</code> block. The <code>finally</code> block
        contains code that the computer executes after all the other
        code in the <code>try</code>, <code>except</code>, and
        <code>else</code> blocks regardless of whether an exception was
        raised or not. The code in the <code>finally</code> block
        usually contains "clean up" code that frees resources that the
        code in the <code>try</code> block used. For example, if the
        code in the <code>try</code> block opens a file, the code in the
        <code>finally</code> block could close that file.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="validate">Example - Validating User Input</h2>
    <p>An example program that validates user input by handling
    exceptions is shown below. Notice there are two <code>try</code>
    blocks in the program: one at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex2">line&nbsp;2</span>
    in the <code>main</code> function and another at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex2">line&nbsp;26</span>
    in the <code>get_float</code> function.</p>

    <p>The <code>try</code> block at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex2">line&nbsp;2</span>
    includes all the regular code in the <code>main</code> function. The
    except block at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex2">line&nbsp;18</span>
    will handle all types of runtime exceptions.
    <code>RuntimeError</code> is probably the most general type of
    exception that we want to handle in a Python program.
    <code>Exception</code> is more general than
    <code>RuntimeError</code>. However, <code>Exception</code> includes
    <code>SyntaxError</code>, and we don't want to handle
    <code>SyntaxError</code>. Instead, we want our program to crash for
    a syntax error and print the line number where the syntax error
    occurred. This is because syntax errors are caused by a programmer
    mistyping code and not by bad user input or missing files. We want a
    programmer to find and fix all syntax errors in a program long
    before the program is given to users.</p>

    <p>The <code>try</code> block at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex2">line&nbsp;26</span>
    is part of a loop that validates user input in the
    <code>get_float</code> function. Notice at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex2">line&nbsp;30</span>
    that the <code>except</code> block handles
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError"><code>ValueError</code></a>
    which is the type of exception that the
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float"><code>float</code></a>
    function raises when it tries to convert text to a number but the
    text contains characters that are not numeric.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python" id="ex2">
def main():
    <em>try:</em>
        gender = input("Enter your gender (M or F): ")

        weight = get_float("Enter your weight in kilograms: ")
        height = get_float("Enter your height in centimeters: ")
        age = get_float("Enter your age in years: ")

        bmr = basal_metabolic_rate(gender, weight, height, age)
        print(f"Your basal metabolic rate is {bmr} calories per day.")

    <em>except RuntimeError as ex:</em>
        print(type(ex).__name__, ex, sep=": ")


def get_float(prompt):
    """Get a number from the user, validate that the user entered
    a number and not some other text, and return the number. If
    the user enters an invalid number, this function will prompt
    the user repeatedly until the user enters a valid number.

    param prompt: A string to display to the user.
    return: The number entered by the user.
    """
    while True:
        <em>try:</em>
            text = input(prompt)
            number = float(text)
            break
        <em>except ValueError:</em>
            print(f"{text} is not a number.")
            print("Please enter a number.")

    return number


def basal_metabolic_rate(gender, weight, height, age):
    """Calculate and return a person's basal metabolic rate (bmr)
    in calories per day. weight must be in kilograms, height must
    be in centimeters, and age must be in years.
    """
    if gender.upper() == "F":
        bmr = 447.593 + 9.247 * weight + 3.098 * height - 4.330 * age
    else:
        bmr = 88.362 + 13.397 * weight + 4.799 * height - 5.677 * age
    return bmr


# Call the main function so that
# this program will start executing.
main()</pre></div>

    <h2>Example - Reading from a File</h2>
    <p>The example program shown below handles exceptions that might
    occur when the program opens and reads from a file. This program
    contains only one <code>try</code> block, which begins at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex3">line&nbsp;4</span>
    and includes all the regular code in the main function.
    This one try block has four <code>except</code> blocks at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex3">lines&nbsp;40, 44,&nbsp;48,
    and&nbsp;52</span>.</p>

    <p>Each of the <code>except</code> blocks handles a different type
    of exception. The first three <code>except</code> blocks handle
    specific exceptions: <code>FileNotFoundError</code>,
    <code>PermissionError</code>, and <code>ZeroDivisionError</code>.
    The last <code>except</code> block handles
    <code>RuntimeError</code>, which is a general exception.
    <code>RuntimeError</code> is probably the most general type of
    exception that we want to handle in a Python program. The
    description above the first example program explains why.</p>
