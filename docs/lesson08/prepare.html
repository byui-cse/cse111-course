    </ul>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn during this lesson:</p>

    <h3>Dictionaries</h3>
    <p>Within a Python program, we can store many items in a
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries">dictionary</a>.
    Dictionaries are mutable, meaning they can be changed after they are
    created. In a dictionary, items are stored as key value pairs. All
    keys within a dictionary must be unique. In other words, no key can
    appear more than once in a dictionary. Values within a dictionary do
    not have to be unique. The following table shows a dictionary that
    contains five items (five key value pairs) Notice that each of the
    keys is unique.</p>

    <table class="center"><thead>
        <tr><th colspan="2">items</th> <th></th></tr>
        <tr><th>keys</th> <th>values</th> <th></th></tr>
    </thead><tbody>
        <tr><td>42-039-4736</td> <td>Clint Huish</td>
            <td class="center">&uarr;</td></tr>
        <tr><td>61-315-0160</td> <td>Michelle Davis</td>
            <td class="center">5</td></tr>
        <tr><td>10-450-1203</td> <td>Jorge Soares</td>
            <td class="center">items</td></tr>
        <tr><td>75-421-2310</td> <td>Abdul Ali</td>
            <td class="center"></td></tr>
        <tr><td>07-103-5621</td> <td>Michelle Davis</td>
            <td class="center">&darr;</td></tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p>We can create a dictionary by using curly braces ({ and }). We
    can add an item to a dictionary and find an item in a dictionary by
    using the square brackets ([&nbsp;and&nbsp;]) and a key. The
    following code example shows how to create a dictionary, add an
    item, remove an item, and find an item in a dictionary.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python" id="ex1">
# Example 1

# Create a dictionary with student IDs as
# the keys and student names as the values.
students = {
    "42-039-4736": "Clint Huish",
    "61-315-0160": "Michelle Davis",
    "10-450-1203": "Jorge Soares",
    "75-421-2310": "Abdul Ali",
    "07-103-5621": "Michelle Davis"
}

# Add an item to the dictionary.
<em>students["81-298-9238"] = "Sama Patel"</em>

# Remove an item from the dictionary.
students.pop("61-315-0160")

# Get the number of items in the dictionary and print it.
length = len(students)
print(length)

# Print the entire dictionary.
print(students)

# Get a student ID from the user.
id = input("Enter a student ID: ")

# Check if the student ID is in the dictionary.
if id in students:

    # Find the student ID in the dictionary and
    # retrieve the corresponding student name.
    <em>name = students[id]</em>

    # Print the student's name.
    print(name)
else:
    print("No such student")</pre></div>

    <p><span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">Line&nbsp;14</span> in the
    previous code example, adds an item to the dictionary. To add an
    item to an existing dictionary, write code that follows this
    template:</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">dictionary_name[key] = value</pre></div>
    <p>Notice that <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;14</span>
    follows this template.</p>

    <p><span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">Line&nbsp;34</span> in the
    previous code example, finds a key and retrieves its corresponding
    value from a dictionary. To find a key and retrieve its
    corresponding value, write code that follows this template:</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">value = dictionary_name[key]</pre></div>
    <p>Notice that <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;34</span>
    follows this template.</p>

    <h3>Compound Values</h3>
    <p>A <dfn>simple value</dfn> is a value that isn't separated into
    parts, such as an integer. A <dfn>compound value</dfn> is a value
    that has parts, such as a list. In example&nbsp;1 above, the
    <var>students</var> dictionary has simple keys and values. Each key
    is a single string and each value is a single string. It is possible
    to store compound values in a dictionary. The next code example
    shows a <var>students</var> dictionary where each value is a Python
    list. Because each list contains multiple parts, we say that
    the dictionary stores compound values.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex2">
# Example 2

# Create a dictionary with student IDs as the keys
# and student data stored in a list as the values.
students = {
    "42-039-4736": ["Clint", "Huish", "hui20001@byui.edu", 16],
    "61-315-0160": ["Michelle", "Davis", "dav21012@byui.edu", 3],
    "10-450-1203": ["Jorge", "Soares", "soa22005@byui.edu", 15],
    "75-421-2310": ["Abdul", "Ali", "ali20003@byui.edu", 5],
    "07-103-5621": ["Michelle", "Davis" "dav19008@byui.edu", 0]
}

# Add an item to the dictionary.
students["81-298-9238"] = ["Sama", "Patel", "pat21004@byui.edu", 8]

# Get a student ID from the user.
id = input("Enter a student ID: ")

# Check if the student ID is in the dictionary.
if id in students:

    # Find the student ID in the dictionary and
    # retrieve the corresponding value, which is a list.
    value = students[id]

    # Retrive the student's given name (first name) and
    # surname (last name or family name) from the list.
    given_name = value[0]
    surname = value[1]

    # Print the student's name.
    print(f"{given_name} {surname}")
else:
    print("No such student")</pre></div>

    <h3 id="findOne">Finding One Item</h3>
    <p>The reason Python dictionaries were developed is to make finding
    items easy and fast. As explained in example&nbsp;1, to find an item
    in a dictionary, a programmer needs to write just one line of code
    that follows this template:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">value = dictionary_name[key]</pre></div>

    <p>That one line of code will cause the computer to search the
    dictionary until it finds the <var>key</var>. Then the computer will
    return the <var>value</var> that corresponds to the <var>key</var>.
    Some students forget how easy it is to find items in a dictionary,
    and when asked to write code to find an item, they write complex
    code like this example.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python" id="ex3">
# Example 3

# Get a student ID from the user.
id = input("Enter a student ID: ")

name = None

<em># This is a difficult and slow way to find an item in a
# dictionary. Don't write code like this to find an item
# in a dictionary!</em>

# For each item in the dictionary, check if
# its key is the same as the variable id.
for key, value in students.items():
    if key == id:
        name = value
        break

if name:
    # Print the student name.
    print(name)
else:
    print("No such student")</pre></div>

    <p>Compare the <code>for</code> loop at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex3">lines&nbsp;14&ndash;17</span> in
    the previous example to this one line of code.</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">    name = students[id]</pre></div>

    <p>Clearly, writing the one line of code is easier for the
    programmer than writing the <code>for</code> loop. Not only is the
    one line of code easier to write, but the computer will execute it
    much, much faster than the <code>for</code> loop. Therefore, when
    you need to write code to find an item in a dictionary, don't write
    a loop. Instead, write one line of code that uses the square
    brackets ([&nbsp;and&nbsp;]) and a key to find an item.
    Example&nbsp;4 shows the correct way to find an item in a
    dictionary.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex4">
# Example 4

# Get a student ID from the user.
id = input("Enter a student ID: ")

<em># This is the correct way to find an item in a dictionary.</em>

# Check if the student ID is in the dictionary.
if id in students:

    # Find the student ID in the dictionary and
    # retrieve the corresponding student name.
    name = students[id]

    # Print the student's name.
    print(name)
else:
    print("No such student")</pre></div>

    <h3 id="processAll">Processing All Items</h3>
    <p>Occaisionally, you may need to write a program that processes all
    the items in a dictionary. Processing all the items in a dictionary
    is done using a <code>for</code> loop and the
    <code>dict.items()</code> method as shown in example&nbsp;5.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex5">
# Example 5

# Create a dictionary with student IDs as the keys
# and student data stored in a list as the values.
students = {
    "42-039-4736": ["Clint", "Huish", "hui20001@byui.edu", 16],
    "61-315-0160": ["Michelle", "Davis", "dav21012@byui.edu", 3],
    "10-450-1203": ["Jorge", "Soares", "soa22005@byui.edu", 15],
    "75-421-2310": ["Abdul", "Ali", "ali20003@byui.edu", 5],
    "07-103-5621": ["Michelle", "Davis" "dav19008@byui.edu", 0],
    "81-298-9238": ["Sama", "Patel", "pat21004@byui.edu", 8]
}

total = 0

# For each item in the list add the number
# of credits that the studen thas earned.
<em>for inumber, value in students.items():</em>

    # Retrieve the number of credits from the value list.
    credits = value[3]

    # Add the number of credits to the total.
    total += credits

print(f"Total credits earned by all students: {total}")</pre></div>

    <h3>Converting between Lists and Dictionaries</h3>
    <p>It is possible to convert two lists into a dictionary by using
    the built-in <code>zip</code> and <code>dict</code> functions. The
    contents of the first list will become the keys in the dictionary,
    and the contents of the second list will become the values. This
    implies that the two lists must have the same length, and the
    elements in the first list must be unique because keys in a
    dictionary must be unique.</p>

    <p>It is also possible to convert a dictionary into two lists by
    using the <code>keys</code> and <code>values</code> methods and the
    built-in <code>list</code> function. The following code example
    starts with two lists, converts them into a dictionary, and then
    converts the dictionary into two lists.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex6">
# Example 6

# Create a list that contains five student numbers.
numbers = ["42-039-4736", "61-315-0160",
        "10-450-1203", "75-421-2310", "07-103-5621"]

# Create a list that contains five student names.
names = ["Clint Huish", "Michelle Davis",
        "Jorge Soares", "Abdul Ali", "Michelle Davis"]

# Convert the numbers list and names list into a dictionary.
<em>student_dict = dict(zip(numbers, names))</em>

# Print the entire student dictionary.
print(student_dict)

# Convert the student dictionary into
# two lists named keys and values.
<em>keys = list(student_dict.keys())
values = list(student_dict.values())</em>

# Print both lists.
print(keys)
print(values)</pre></div>
