    </ul>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn during this lesson:</p>

    <h3>Dictionaries</h3>
    <p>Within a Python program, a program can store many items in a
    <dfn>dictionary</dfn>. Each <dfn>item</dfn> in a dictionary is a key
    value pair. Each <dfn>key</dfn> within a dictionary must be unique.
    In other words, no key can appear more than once in a dictionary.
    Values within a dictionary do not have to be unique. Dictionaries
    are mutable, meaning they can be changed after they are created.
    Dictionaries were invented to enable computers to find items
    quickly.</p>

    <p>The following table represents a dictionary that contains five
    items (five key value pairs) Notice that each of the keys is
    unique.</p>

    <table class="center"><thead>
        <tr><th colspan="2">items</th> <th></th></tr>
        <tr><th>keys</th> <th>values</th> <th></th></tr>
    </thead><tbody>
        <tr><td>42-039-4736</td> <td>Clint Huish</td>
            <td class="center">&uarr;</td></tr>
        <tr><td>61-315-0160</td> <td>Michelle Davis</td>
            <td class="center">5</td></tr>
        <tr><td>10-450-1203</td> <td>Jorge Soares</td>
            <td class="center">items</td></tr>
        <tr><td>75-421-2310</td> <td>Abdul Ali</td>
            <td class="center">|</td></tr>
        <tr><td>07-103-5621</td> <td>Michelle Davis</td>
            <td class="center">&darr;</td></tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <p>We can create a dictionary by using curly braces
    ({&nbsp;and&nbsp;}). We can add an item to a dictionary and find an
    item in a dictionary by using square brackets ([&nbsp;and&nbsp;])
    and a key. The following code example shows how to create a
    dictionary, add an item, remove an item, and find an item in a
    dictionary.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex1"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 1

def main():
    # Create a dictionary with student IDs as
    # the keys and student names as the values.
    students = {
        "42-039-4736": "Clint Huish",
        "61-315-0160": "Michelle Davis",
        "10-450-1203": "Jorge Soares",
        "75-421-2310": "Abdul Ali",
        "07-103-5621": "Michelle Davis"
    }

    # Add an item to the dictionary.
    <em>students["81-298-9238"] = "Sama Patel"</em>

    # Remove an item from the dictionary.
    students.pop("61-315-0160")

    # Get the number of items in the dictionary and print it.
    length = len(students)
    print(f"length: {length}")

    # Print the entire dictionary.
    print(students)
    print()

    # Get a student ID from the user.
    id = input("Enter a student ID: ")

    # Check if the student ID is in the dictionary.
    if id in students:

        # Find the student ID in the dictionary and
        # retrieve the corresponding student name.
        <em>name = students[id]</em>

        # Print the student's name.
        print(name)

    else:
        print("No such student")


# Call main to start this program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="ex1">&gt; python example_1.py
length: 5
{'42-039-4736': 'Clint Huish', '10-450-1203': 'Jorge Soares',
'75-421-2310': 'Abdul Ali', '07-103-5621': 'Michelle Davis',
'81-298-9238': 'Sama Patel'}

Enter a student ID: <span class="input">10-450-1203</span>
Jorge Soares</pre>

    <p><span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">Line&nbsp;15</span> in the
    previous code example, adds an item to the dictionary. To add an
    item to an existing dictionary, write code that follows this
    template:</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">    <var>dictionary_name</var>[<var>key</var>] = <var>value</var></pre></div>
    <p>Notice that <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;15</span>
    follows this template.</p>

    <p><span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">Line&nbsp;36</span> in the
    previous code example, finds a key and retrieves its corresponding
    value from a dictionary. To find a key and retrieve its
    corresponding value, write code that follows this template:</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">    <var>value</var> = <var>dictionary_name</var>[<var>key</var>]</pre></div>
    <p>Notice that <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;36</span>
    follows this template.</p>

    <h3>Compound Values</h3>
    <p>A <dfn>simple value</dfn> is a value that doesn't contain parts,
    such as an integer. A <dfn>compound value</dfn> is a value that has
    parts, such as a list. In example&nbsp;1 above, the
    <var>students</var> dictionary has simple keys and values. Each key
    is a single string, and each value is a single string. It is
    possible to store compound values in a dictionary. Example&nbsp;2
    shows a <var>students</var> dictionary where each value is a Python
    list. Because each list contains multiple parts, we say that the
    dictionary stores compound values.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex2"><pre class="python"># Example 2

def main():
    # Create a dictionary with student IDs as the keys
    # and student data stored in a list as the values.
    students = {
        # student_ID: [given_name, surname, email_address, credits]
        "42-039-4736": ["Clint", "Huish", "hui20001@byui.edu", 16],
        "61-315-0160": ["Michelle", "Davis", "dav21012@byui.edu", 3],
        "10-450-1203": ["Jorge", "Soares", "soa22005@byui.edu", 15],
        "75-421-2310": ["Abdul", "Ali", "ali20003@byui.edu", 5],
        "07-103-5621": ["Michelle", "Davis" "dav19008@byui.edu", 0]
    }

</pre></div>

    <h3 id="findOne">Finding One Item</h3>
    <p>The reason Python dictionaries were developed is to make finding
    items easy and fast. As explained in example&nbsp;1, to find an item
    in a dictionary, a programmer needs to write just one line of code
    that follows this template:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">    <var>value</var> = <var>dictionary_name</var>[<var>key</var>]</pre></div>

    <p>That one line of code will cause the computer to search the
    dictionary until it finds the <var>key</var>. Then the computer will
    return the <var>value</var> that corresponds to the <var>key</var>.
    Some students forget how easy it is to find items in a dictionary,
    and when asked to write code to find an item, they write complex
    code like
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex3">lines&nbsp;24&ndash;28</span>
    in example&nbsp;3.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex3"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 3

def main():
    # Create a dictionary with student IDs as the keys
    # and student data stored in a list as the values.
    students = {
        # student_ID: [given_name, surname, email_address, credits]
        "42-039-4736": ["Clint", "Huish", "hui20001@byui.edu", 16],
        "61-315-0160": ["Michelle", "Davis", "dav21012@byui.edu", 3],
        "10-450-1203": ["Jorge", "Soares", "soa22005@byui.edu", 15],
        "75-421-2310": ["Abdul", "Ali", "ali20003@byui.edu", 5],
        "07-103-5621": ["Michelle", "Davis" "dav19008@byui.edu", 0]
    }

    # Get a student ID from the user.
    id = input("Enter a student ID: ")

    <em># This is a difficult and slow way to find an item in a
    # dictionary. Don't write code like this to find an item
    # in a dictionary!</em>

    # For each item in the dictionary, check if
    # its key is the same as the variable id.
    student = None
    for key, value in students.items(): <em># Bad example!</em>
        if key == id:                   <em># Don't use a loop like</em>
            student = value             <em># this to find an item</em>
            break                       <em># in a dictionary.</em>
</pre></div>

    <p>Compare the <code>for</code> loop at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex3">lines&nbsp;24&ndash;28</span> in
    the previous example to this one line of code.</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">    value = students[id]</pre></div>

    <p>Clearly, writing the one line of code is easier for the
    programmer than writing the <code>for</code> loop. Not only is the
    one line of code easier to write, but the computer will execute it
    much, much faster than the <code>for</code> loop. Therefore, when
    you need to write code to find an item in a dictionary, don't write
    a loop. Instead, write one line of code that uses the square
    brackets ([&nbsp;and&nbsp;]) and a key to find an item.
    Example&nbsp;4 shows the correct way to find an item in a
    dictionary.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex4"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 4

def main():
    # Create a dictionary with student IDs as the keys
    # and student data stored in a list as the values.

    }

    # These are the indexes of the elements in the value lists.

    id = input("Enter a student ID: ")

    # Check if the student ID is in the dictionary.
    if id in students:

        # Find the student ID in the dictionary and
        # retrieve the corresponding value, which is a list.
        value = students[id]

        # surname (last name or family name) from the list.
        given_name = value[GIVEN_NAME_INDEX]
        surname = value[SURNAME_INDEX]

        # Print the student's name.
        print(f"{given_name} {surname}")

    <h3 id="processAll">Processing All Items</h3>
    <p>Occasionally, you may need to write a program that processes all
    the items in a dictionary. Processing all the items in a dictionary
    is different than finding one item in a dictionary. Processing all
    the items is done using a <code>for</code> loop and the
    <code>dict.items()</code> method as shown in example&nbsp;5 on
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">line&nbsp;25</span>.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex5"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 5

def main():
    # Create a dictionary with student IDs as the keys
    # and student data stored in a list as the values.

    <p>As with all the example code in CSE&nbsp;111, example&nbsp;5
    contains working Python code. Even though the code works, we can
    combine <span class="cross" data-ref="ex5">lines&nbsp;25&ndash;27</span>
    into a single line of code by using a Python shortcut called
    unpacking. Instead of writing lines&nbsp;25&ndash;27, like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
    for item in students.items():
        key = item[0]
        value = item[1]</pre></div>

    <p>We can write one line of code that combines the three lines of
    code and unpacks the item in the <code>for</code> statement like
    this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
    for key, value in students.items():</pre></div>

    <p>Example&nbsp;6 contains the same code as example&nbsp;5 except
    example&nbsp;6 uses the Python unpacking shortcut at

    <h3>Converting between Lists and Dictionaries</h3>
    <p>It is possible to convert two lists into a dictionary by using
    the built-in <code>zip</code> and <code>dict</code> functions. The
    contents of the first list will become the keys in the dictionary,
    and the contents of the second list will become the values. This
    implies that the two lists must have the same length, and the
    elements in the first list must be unique because keys in a
    dictionary must be unique.</p>

    <p>It is also possible to convert a dictionary into two lists by
    using the <code>keys</code> and <code>values</code> methods and the
    built-in <code>list</code> function. The following code example
    starts with two lists, converts them into a dictionary, and then
    converts the dictionary into two lists.</p>

    # Create a list that contains five student numbers.

    # Create a list that contains five student names.
