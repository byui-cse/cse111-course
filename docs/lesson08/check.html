    <h1>08 Checkpoint: Dictionaries</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Complete this individual checkpoint assignment to improve your
    understanding of how to use a dictionary in a Python program.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><div>The <a href="prepare.html">prepare content</a> for this
        lesson explains how to find items in a dictionary.</div></li>

        <li><div>The <a href="../lesson07/prepare.html">prepare
        content</a> for lesson 7 explains how to retrieve an element
        from a list.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Do the following:</p>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Open a new file in VS Code.</div></li>

        <li><div>Copy and paste this program into your new file and save
        it as <code>vehicles.py</code>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
def main():
    # Create a dictionary that contains data about six vehicles.
    # The key for each vehicle in the dictionary is the vehicle's
    # identification number (VIN). The value for each vehicle is
    # a list that contains the year, manufacturer, model, color,
    # engine design, and engine displacement.
    vehicles = {
        "1J4GL48K4UF993861": [2002, "Jeep", "Liberty", "blue", "V6", 3.7],
        "1YVGF22C8AN381568": [2002, "Mazda", "626", "white", "I4", 2.0],
        "WP0AA0926HG410293": [1987, "Porsche", "924S", "red", "I4", 2.5],
        "5TDZA23CXTU102983": [2006, "Toyota", "Sienna", "gold", "V6", 3.3],
        "1GKKVRED5ZL382610": [2011, "GMC", "Acadia", "charcoal", "V6", 3.5],
        "2T3BF4DV9QR146782": [2012, "Toyota", "RAV 4", "green", "I4", 2.5]
    }

    # Ask the user for a vehicle identification number (VIN).
    vin = input("Please enter a VIN: ")

    # Check if the vin is a key that is in the vehicles dictionary.
    if pass:

        # Find the data for the vehicle that the user wants.
        pass

        # Print the manufacturer, model, and color of the vehicle.
        # Don't print the year, engine design, or displacement.
        pass




    else:
        # Print a message stating that the VIN entered
        # by the user is not in the dictionary.
        print("That VIN is not in the dictionary.")


# If this file was executed like this:
# &gt; python teach_solution.py
# then call the main function. However, if this file
# was simply imported, then skip the call to main.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div></div></li>

        <li><div>Using VS Code, read the comments in the program. Then
        replace all three occurences of the keyword <code>pass</code>
        with code that does what the comments describe.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Runs</h2>
<pre class="console">&gt; python vehicles.py
Please enter a VIN: <span class="input">QT71603</span>
That VIN is not in the dictionary.

&gt; python vehicles.py
Please enter a VIN: <span class="input">5TDZA23CXTU102983</span>
Toyota Sienna gold</pre>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each
    step in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="test">
        <li><div>Run your program and ensure that your program's output
        matches the sample run output.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>When your program is finished, view the <a download
    href="check_solution.py">sample solution</a> for this assignment to
    compare your solution to that one. Before looking at the sample
    solution, you should work to complete this checkpoint program first.
    However, if you have worked on it for at least an hour and are still
    having problems, feel free to use the sample solution to help you
    finish your program.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When complete, report your progress in the associated I-Learn
    quiz.</p>
