    <h1>08 Team Activity: Dictionaries</h1>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Arrange a one hour synchronous meeting with your team for this
    activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing meeting.
    Campus students will use class time for this meeting. You should
    prepare for this meeting by completing the preparation material and
    the individual checkpoint assignment beforehand.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints uses lots of
    computer technology to collect and store family history data,
    including data about individuals and marriages. Interestingly, the
    data about individuals must be stored separately from the data about
    marriages because some individuals get married multiple times.
    However, in order to make the data understandable to people, when a
    person views marriage data, a program must combine the marriage data
    with the data about individuals in the marriage.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Write a Python program that stores data about individuals in one
    dictionary and stores data about marriages in a different
    dictionary. Your program must combine the data in the two
    dictionaries and print the combined data so that it is understandble
    to a user. Copy and paste the following code into a new program
    named <code>family_history.py</code></p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
# Each value in the people dictionary is a list. These
# are the indexes of the elements in those lists.

    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Within your program, the <code>print_death_age</code>
        function must print the name and age at death for each person in
        the people dictionary.</div></li>

        <li><div>The <code>count_genders</code> function must count and
        print the number of males and the number of females in the
        people dictionary.</div></li>

        <li><div>The <code>print_marriages</code> function must print
        the following for each marriage in the marriages dictionary:
        <ol>
            <li><div>The name and age in the wedding year of the
            husband</div></li>
            <li><div>The year of the wedding</div></li>
            <li><div>The name and age in the wedding year of the
            wife</div></li>
        </ol>
        </div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an
    hour, complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that
    the stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Add code to the <code>print_death_age</code> function
        that prints the birth year and death year for each
        person.</div></li>

        <!--
        <li><div>Add to your program a function named
        <code>print_marriages_for_person</code> that asks the user for a
        person key. Then the function should print the person's name and
        for all the marriages of that person, print the wedding year and
        spouse's name. If there are no marriages in the marriage
        dictionary for the person specified by the user, the function
        should print, "No marriage data." Recall that a person_key
        begins with the letter "P" and has three digits after the
        "P".</div></li>
        -->

        <li><div>Add to your program a function named
        <code>count_marriages</code> that counts and prints the number
        of marriages that each person had in his or her lifetime.
        According to the data, who married the most times?</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><div>The <a href="prepare.html">prepare</a> content for this
        lesson explains how to wrap <code>try</code> and
        <code>except</code> around a normal block of code. It also
        includes an example that shows how to
        <a href="prepare.html#validate">validate user input</a>
        within a loop.</div></li>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="test">
        <li><div>Run your <code>family_history.py</code> program and
        verify that it prints the same results as shown in the Sample
        Run section above.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to this
    <a download href="teach_solution1.py">first sample solution</a> or
    to this
    <a download href="teach_solution2.py">second sample solution</a>
    which is better organized because it is split into three more
    functions than the first solution. Please <strong>do not look at the
    sample solutions</strong> until you have either finished the program
    or diligently worked for at least one hour. At the end of the hour,
    if you are still struggling to complete the assignment, you may use
    the sample solution to help you finish.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
