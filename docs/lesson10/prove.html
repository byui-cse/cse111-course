    <h1>10 Prove Assignment: Handling Exceptions</h1>

    <section>
    <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a Python program that handles
    exceptions, including <code>FileNotFoundError</code> and
    <code>KeyError</code>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2 id="problem">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>A local grocery store subscribes to an online service that
    enables its customers to order groceries online. After a customer
    completes an order, the online service sends a CSV file that
    contains the customer’s requests to the grocery store. The store
    needs you to write a program that reads the CSV file and prints to
    the terminal window a receipt that lists the purchased items and
    shows the subtotal, the sales tax amount, and the total.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2 id="assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>During the <a href="../lesson09/prove.html">prove milestone for
    the previous lesson</a>, you wrote the part of this program that
    reads and processes two CSV files, one named
    <code>products.csv</code> that contains a catalog of products and
    one named <code>request.csv</code> that contains a customer’s order.
    During this prove assignment, you will add code to finish printing a
    receipt and to handle any exceptions that might occur while your
    program is running. Specifically, your program must do the
    following:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Print the store name at the top of the receipt.</div></li>
        <li><div>Print the list of ordered items.</div></li>
        <li><div>Sum and print the number of ordered items.</div></li>
        <li><div>Sum and print the subtotal due.</div></li>
        <li><div>Compute and print the sales tax amount. Use 6% as the
        sales tax rate.</div></li>
        <li><div>Compute and print the total amount due.</div></li>
        <li><div>Print a thank you message.</div></li>
        <li><div>Get the current date and time from your computer’s
        operating system and print the current date and time.</div></li>
        <li><div>Include a <code>try</code> block and
        <code>except</code> blocks to handle
        <code>FileNotFoundError</code> and
        <code>KeyError</code>.</div></li>
    </ol>

        <li><div>The <a href="../lesson09/prove.html">prove milestone</a>
        of the previous lesson describes the two CSV files that your
        program must process.</div></li>

        <li><div>The <a href="prepare.html">preparation content</a> for
        this lesson explains how to handle exceptions.</div></li>

        <li><div>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.now"><code>datetime.now() method</code></a>
        from the standard Python <code>datetime</code> module
        will get the current date and time from your computer’s
        operating system. Here is an excerpt from the official
        documentation for the <code>datetime.now</code> method:
        <dl class="function">
            <dt><pre class="python">datetime.now(tz=None)</pre></dt>
            <dd>Return the current local date and time.
            <p><var>tz</var> is optional, but if it is not
            <code>None</code>, it must be a <code>tzinfo</code> (time
            zone information) object</p></dd>
        </dl>

        <p>These two Microsoft videos explain how to use methods from
        the standard <code>datetime</code> module.</p>
        <ul class="videos">
            <li><div><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/intro-to-python-development/python-for-beginners-15-of-44-date-data-types">Date data types</a> <span class="duration">(8 minutes)</span></div></li>

        </ul>

        <p>The following Python code imports the <code>datetime</code>
        class from the <code>datetime</code> module and calls the
        <code>datetime.now</code> method to get the current date and
        time from a computer’s operating system. Then it uses an
        f-string to format and print the current date and time.</p>

<div class="example" id="ex1"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python">
# Import the datetime class from the datetime
# module so that it can be used in this program.
from datetime import datetime

# Call the now() method to get the current
# date and time as a datetime object from
# the computer's operating system.
current_date_and_time = datetime.now()

# Use an f-string to print the current
# day of the week and the current time.
print(f"{current_date_and_time:%A %I:%M %p}")</pre>

<pre class="console">&gt; python example_1.py
Tuesday 01:23 PM</pre>
</div>

        <p>After the computer executes
        <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;8</span> in the
        above code, the variable <var>current_date_and_time</var> will
        hold the current date and time. Within the f-string at
        <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;12</span>,
        the string sequences that begin with the percent symbol (%) are
        called format codes. The
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes">format codes and their meaning</a>
        are listed in the official Python <code>datetime</code>
        reference. As shown in the terminal window above, the previous
        example code will print the current day of the week and time to
        the terminal window.</p>

    <p>You could use a generative AI as a tutor to help you write and
    troubleshoot your program. Bro. Lee Barney created a custom Chat GPT
    named Pythonista that is fine-tuned to focus on Python functions,
    loops, if statements, and related programming concepts.
    If your program is generating an error, ask
    <a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-sQydCh2Q6-pythonista">Pythonista</a>
    a question like this:</p>

    <blockquote><p>I'm writing a Python program that generates a sales
    receipt for a retail grocery store. When I run my program, it causes
    the following error. Please suggest some mistakes that might cause
    this error.</p>
    <p><b>(Copy and paste the error message here.)</b></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>You could also ask
    <a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-sQydCh2Q6-pythonista">Pythonista</a>
    a question about one of your functions, like this:</p>

    <blockquote><p>I wrote the following Python function that is
    supposed to <b>(type a short description here)</b>. However, the
    function isn't <b>(type what it's not doing correctly here)</b>.
    Please help me fix this function.</p>

    <h2 id="testing">Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>

    <ol class="test long">
        <li><div>Run your program and verify that it prints a receipt
        formatted similarly to the one shown below. Your program must
        print the current date and time with exactly the same formatting
        as shown below. Also, verify that your program computes the
        number of items, subtotal, sales tax, and total as shown below.

        </div></li>

        <li><div><p>Verify that the <code>except</code> block to handle
        <code>KeyError</code> that you added to your program works
        correctly by doing the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><div>Temporarily add the following line to the end of
            your <code>requests.csv</code> file and then save the file.
<div class="example"><pre class="csv">R002,5</pre></div>
            </div></li>
            <li><div>Run your program again and verify that it prints an
            error message like the one shown below.
<pre class="console">&gt; python receipt.py
Error: unknown product ID in the request.csv file
'R002'</pre>
            Hint: if you wrote an <code>except</code> block in your
            program to handle <code>KeyError</code> and added "R002,5"
            to the <code>requests.csv</code> file and saved the
            <code>requests.csv</code> file and ran your program but your
            program isn’t raising a <code>KeyError</code>, then look in
            your program to see if you wrote an <code>if</code>
            statement before the statement that finds a value in the
            <var>products</var> dictionary. Look for code similar to
            this:

<div class="example"><pre class="python">
    <em>if prod_num in products_dict:</em>
        prod_info_list = products_dict[prod_num]
        ⋮
</pre></div>

            If your program contains an <code>if</code> statement
            similar to the one above, then the <code>if</code> statement
            is probably preventing your program from raising a
            <code>KeyError</code>. Delete the <code>if</code> statement
            and unindent the lines of code inside the <code>if</code>
            statement and test your program again.
            </div></li>
        </ol>
        </div></li>

        <li><div><p>Verify that the <code>except</code> block to handle
        <code>FileNotFoundError</code> that you added to your program
        works correctly by doing the following:</p>
        <ol class="long">
            <li><div>Temporarily delete or rename the
            <code>products.csv</code> file.</div></li>
            <li><div>Run your program again and verify that it prints an
            error message like the one shown below.
<pre class="console">&gt; python receipt.py
Error: missing file
[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'products.csv'</pre>
            </div></li>
        </ol>
        </div></li>

    <h2 id="exceed">Exceeding the Requirements</h2>
    <p>If your program fulfills the requirements for this assignment as
    described in the previous prove milestone and the Assignment section
    above, your program will earn 93% of the possible points. In order
    to earn the remaining 7% of points, you will need to add one or more
    features to your program so that it exceeds the requirements. Here
    are a few suggestions for additional features that you could add to
    your program if you wish.</p>

    <ul class="long">
        <li><div>Write code to print at the bottom of the receipt an
        invitation for the customer to complete an online
        survey.</div></li>
        <li><div>Write code to print a coupon at the bottom of the
        receipt. Write the code so that it will always print a coupon
        for one of the products ordered by the customer.</div></li>
        <li><div>Write code to print at the bottom of the receipt the
        return by date that is seven days into the future.</div></li>
        <li><div>Write code to print at the bottom of the receipt the
        number of days until the New Year's Sale begins (January
        1).</div></li>
        <li><div>Write code to discount the product prices by 10% if
        today is Tuesday or Wednesday.</div></li>
        <li><div>Write code to discount the product prices by 10% if the
        current time of day is before 11:00 a.m.</div></li>
    </ul>
