    <h1>10 Prove Assignment: Data Visualization</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a Python program that uses
    <code>pandas</code> to read and analyze data and draw plots to help
    a user visualize trends in the data.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><div>The <code>pandas</code> Getting Started Tutorials
        contain a helpful <a target="_blank"
        href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/intro_tutorials/04_plotting.html">short section about creating plots</a>.</div></li>

        <li><div>The <code>pandas</code> User Guide contains a
        <a target="_blank"
        href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/visualization.html">long section about creating plots</a>.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>During this assignment, you will write and test the remaining
    parts of the Python program that you began during the previous
    <a target="_blank" href="../lesson09/prove.html">lesson's
    milestone</a>. Do the following:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>In the Python program that you began in the previous
        lesson's milestone, write the code for the <code>get_int</code>,
        <code>insert_after</code>, and <code>show_meter_usage</code> and
        <code>show_comparison</code> functions.</div></li>

        <li><div>Add any additional functions that you would like to
        write, including functions to draw additional plots.</div></li>

        <li><div>Modify the code in the <code>main</code> function so
        that your program allows a user to enter a water meter number, a
        start year, and an end year and then displays at least two
        plots to help the user visualize the data for the given meter
        number.</div></li>

        <li><div>Test your individual functions and program.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <!--
    Notice also that while reading the function description for the
    <code>main</code> function, it may seem that <code>main</code>
    violates the rule that each function must perform one task only.
    However, <code>main</code> does perform one high-level task only.
    Its task is to fulfill the requirements of the program by calling
    the other functions.
    -->

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each
    step in this testing procedure:</p>

    <ol class="test long">
        <li><div>Download, examine, and run this Python file named
        <a download href="test_meter_usage.py"><code>test_meter_usage.py</code></a>
        that contains <code>pytest</code> test functions. Verify that
        all the test functions pass. If they don't pass, fix the
        mistakes in your code until they do pass.</div></li>

        <li><div>Run your program with the inputs shown in the Sample
        Run section. Verify that your program displays the correct data
        formatted similarly to the two plots shown in the Sample Run
        section.</div></li>

        <li><div>If you chose to add code to your program so that it
        displays more plots than the two required ones, verify that the
        plots are correct.</div></li>

        <li><div>Run your program with other inputs. Verify that your
        program correctly validates user input and displays correct
        plots.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="run">Sample Run</h2>
<pre class="console">&gt; python prove_solution

Enter a meter number ('q' to quit): <span class="input">M5211</span>
Enter a start year between 2015 and 2019, inclusive: <span class="input">2018</span>
Enter an end year between 2018 and 2019, inclusive: <span class="input">2019</span>

Enter a meter number ('q' to quit): q</pre>

    alt="A vertical bar plot showing the water used by meter #M5211"
    title="A vertical bar plot showing the water used by meter #M5211"></p>

    <p><img src="m5211_median.png"
    alt="A line plot showing the water used by meter #M5211 and the

    title="A line plot showing the water used by meter #M5211 and the
    median for water meters of the same account type as M5211"></p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>To submit your program, return to I-Learn and do these two
    things:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Upload your program (the .py file) for feedback.</div></li>
        <li><div>Add a submission comment that specifies the grading
        category that best describes your program along with a one or
        two sentence justification for your choice. The grading criteria
        are:
        <ul>
            <li><div>1. Some attempt made</div></li>
            <li><div>2. Developing but significantly deficient</div></li>
            <li><div>3. Slightly deficient</div></li>
            <li><div>4. Meets requirements</div></li>
            <li><div>5. Exceeds requirements</div></li>
        </ul></div></li>
    </ol>
