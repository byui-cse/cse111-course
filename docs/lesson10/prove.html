    <h1>10 Prove Assignment: Handling Exceptions</h1>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a Python program that handles
    exceptions, including FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, and
    KeyError.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>A local grocery store subscribes to an online service that
    enables its customers to order groceries online. After a customer
    completes an order, the online service sends a CSV file to the
    grocery store. The store needs you to write a program that reads the
    CSV file and prints (to the terminal window) a receipt that lists
    the purchased items and shows the subtotal, the sales tax amount,
    and the total.</p>

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <ul class="long">
        <li><div>The <a href="prepare.html">prepare</a> content for this
        lesson explains how to handle exceptions.</div></li>

        <li><div><p>The <code>datetime</code> module contains the
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.now"><code>now</code> method</a>,
        which will get the current date and time from your computer's
        operating system. To get the current date and time from your
        computer's operating system, import the <code>datetime</code>
        module and call the <code>datetime.now</code> method. Then use
        an f-string to format and print the current date and time as
        shown in this example code:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
# Import the datatime module so that
# it can be used in this program.
from datetime import datetime

# Call the now() method to get the current date and
# time as a datetime object from the computer's clock.
current_date_and_time = datetime.now()

# Format and print the current date and time to include
# only the day of the week, the hour, and the minute.
print(f"{current_date_and_time:%A %I:%M %p}")</pre></div>

        <p>After the computer executes the above code, the variable
        <var>current_date_and_time</var> will hold the current date and
        time. In the previous example, the string sequences that begin
        with the percent symbol (%) are called format codes. The format
        codes and their meaning are listed
        in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes">this document</a>.
        When executed, the previous example will print the current date
        and time to the terminal window like this:</p>

<pre class="console">&gt; python example.py
Tuesday 01:23 PM</pre>
        </div></li>

        <li><div><a href="https://content.byui.edu/items/a9e60503-b5e7-40f0-bf48-ebf1a7441d25/1/example_04.mp4">This video</a>
        shows a BYU-Idaho faculty member writing code that prints the
        current date and time formatted so that users can easily read
        it.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>During the prove assignment for lesson&nbsp;9, you wrote the part
    of this program that reads and processes two CSV files, one named
    <code>products.csv</code> that contains a catalog of products and
    one named <code>request.csv</code> that contains a customer's
    order. During this prove assignment (for lesson&nbsp;10), you will
    add code to finish printing a receipt and to handle any exceptions
    that might occur while your program is running. Specifically, your
    program must do the following:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Print the store name at the top of the receipt.</div></li>
        <li><div>Print the list of ordered items.</div></li>
        <li><div>Sum and print the number of ordered items.</div></li>
        <li><div>Sum and print the subtotal due.</div></li>
        <li><div>Compute and print the sales tax amount. Use 6% as the
        sales tax rate.</div></li>
        <li><div>Compute and print the total amount due.</div></li>
        <li><div>Print a thank you message.</div></li>
        <li><div>Get the current date and time from your computer's
        operating system and print the current date and time.</div></li>
        <li><div>Include a <code>try</code> block and
        <code>except</code> blocks to handle
        <code>FileNotFoundError</code>, <code>PermissionError</code>,
        and <code>KeyError</code>.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>

    <ol class="test long">
        <li><div>Run your program and verify that it computes the
        number of items, subtotal, sales tax, and total as shown in the
        Sample Run section below.</div></li>

        <li><div>Verify that your program prints a receipt formatted
        exactly like the one shown in the Sample Run section below,
        except the last line with the date and time will have a
        different value and may be formatted differently.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>To submit your program, return to I-Learn and do these two
    things:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><div>Upload your program (the .py file) for feedback.</div></li>
        <li><div>Add a submission comment that specifies the grading
        category that best describes your program along with a one or
        two sentence justification for your choice. The grading criteria
        are:
        <ul>
            <li><div>1. Some attempt made</div></li>
            <li><div>2. Developing but significantly deficient</div></li>
