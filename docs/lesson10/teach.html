    <h1>10 Team Activity: </h1>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Arrange a one hour synchronous meeting with your team for this
    activity. Online students should coordinate a video-sharing meeting.
    Campus students will use class time for this meeting. You should
    prepare for this meeting by completing the preparation material and
    the individual checkpoint assignment beforehand.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Write a Python program that uses <code>pandas</code> and includes
    several functions to answer these two questions about the
    <a download href="water.csv">water usage data</a> from the City of
    Rexburg:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Is the total amount of water used in the City of
        Rexburg increasing each year?</div></li>
        <li><div>Is the average amount of water used per dwelling
        increasing each year?</div></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Your program should compute actual numbers from the water meter
    data that answer the two questions above. Your program should print
    those numbers formatted nicely as shown in the sample run below and
    should draw at least two plots to help a user visualize the data
    that is printed out.</p>

    <p><b>Note</b>: If you examine closely the water data, you will see
    that some water meters serve both a business and one or more
    apartments. When analyzing data to answer the <em>second</em>
    question, your program should exclude the water usage data for such
    meters because there is no way to determine how much water went to
    the business and how much went to the attached apartment. In fact,
    when answering the <em>second</em> question, your program should use
    only the data for apartment complexes, residences, town homes, and
    trailer courts.</p>

    <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>Your program must be split into at least three
        functions:
        <ol>
            <li><div><code>main</code></div></li>
            <li><div>A function that shows a plot to answer the first
            question in this assigment.</div></li>
            <li><div>A function that shows a plot to answer the second
            question in this assigment.</div></li>
        </ol></div></li>

        <li><div>Your program must call <code>pd.read_csv</code> to read
        the <code>water.csv</code> file into a DataFrame and must add to
        the DataFrame a new column named "year" that contains only the
        year part of the "readDate" column.</div></li>

        <li><div>Your program must compute the sum of the water usage
        grouped by year and must display a vertical bar chart that shows
        total water usage in Rexburg by year.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Stretch Challenges</h3>
    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an
    hour, complete one or more of these stretch challenges. Note that
    the stretch challenges are optional.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><div>Add code to filter, group, and aggregate the water
        usage data and to display a vertical bar chart that answers the
        second question of this assignment.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Run</h2>
<pre class="console">&gt; python prove_solution.py

Total usage for all account types (in 1000 gallons):
      sumUsage

2017   1880506
2018   1999372
2019   2325421

Average total usage per dwelling (in 1000 gallons):
      sumUsage  numDwellings  usagePerDwelling

2015   1108284       32181.9              34.4

2019   1117934       35919.1              31.1</pre>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each step
    in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="test long">
        <li><div>Run your program and verify that it prints the correct
        results, rounded and formatted as shown in the sample run
        above.</div></li>

        <li><div>Examine the two vertical bar charts displayed by your
        program and verify that the two charts show the same values as
        the printed results.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Ponder</h2>
    <p>Examine the printed output and the plots displayed by your
    program. What are the answers to the two questions in the
    "Assignment" section?</p>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your team for the one hour meeting.
    After the meeting is over, please compare your approach to the
    <a download href="teach_solution.py">sample solution</a>. Please
    <strong>do not look at the sample solution</strong> until you have
    either finished the program or diligently worked for at least one
    hour. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling to
    complete the assignment, you may use the sample solution to help you
    finish.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When you have finished the activity, please report your progress
    via the associated I-Learn quiz. When asked about which of the
    requirements you completed, feel free to include any work done
    during the team meeting or after the meeting, including work done
    with the help of the sample solution, if necessary. In short, report
    on what you were able to accomplish, regardless of when you
    completed it or if you needed help from the sample solution.</p>
