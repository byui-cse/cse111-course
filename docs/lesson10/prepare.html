    <h1>10 Prepare: Handling Exceptions</h1>
    <p>Errors and exceptional situations sometimes occur while a program
    is running. Such errors include a program attempting to read from a
    file that doesn't exist, a connection error when connecting to a
    server on a network, data that cannot be found on a server, and
    calculations that produce undefined results. A well written program
    doesn't crash when an error occurs but instead handles errors in a
    graceful manner that may include adjusting to an error, printing an
    error message for the user to see, and saving an error message to a
    log file. During this lesson, you will learn to write code that
    handles errors that may occur while your Python program is
    running.</p>

    <h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn during this lesson.</p>

    <h3 id="exception">What Is an Exception?</h3>
    <p>An <dfn>exception</dfn> is a relatively rare event that sometimes
    occurs while a Python program is running. For example, an exception
    occurs when a Python program tries to open a file for reading, and
    that file doesn't exist. There are many different
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html">built-in
    exceptions</a> that may occur while a Python program is running.</p>

    <p>When an exceptional event occurs, a Python function
    <dfn>raises</dfn> an exception which may be handled by code at
    another location in the executing Python program. The Python keyword
    to raise an exception is <code>raise</code>. Normally, you will not
    need to write code to raise an exception because the built-in
    functions, such as <code>open</code>, <code>int</code>, and
    <code>float</code>, will raise an exception when necessary. You will
    need to write code in your programs to handle exceptions.</p>

    <h3 id="handle_except">How to Handle an Exception</h3>
    <p>The Python keywords to handle exceptions are <code>try</code>,
    <code>except</code>, <code>else</code>, and <code>finally</code>.
    The following example code contains the outline of a complete
    try-except-else-finally block. Read the code and its comments
    carefully to understand the correct syntax and organization of a
    try-except-else-finally block.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex1"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python"># Example 1

<em>try</em>:
    # Write normal code here. This block must include
    # code that falls into two groups:
    # 1. Code that may cause an exception to be raised
    # 2. Code that depends on the results of the code
    #    in the first group
<em>except ZeroDivisionError as zero_div_err:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in the try
    # block caused a function to raise a ZeroDivisionError.
<em>except ValueError as val_err:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in the
    # try block caused a function to raise a ValueError.
<em>except (TypeError, KeyError, IndexError) as error:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in the
    # try block caused a function to raise a TypeError,
    # KeyError, or IndexError.
<em>except Exception as excep:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in the try
    # block caused a function to raise any exception that
    # was not handled by one of the previous except blocks.
<em>except:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in the
    # try block caused a function to raise anything that
    # was not handled by one of the previous except blocks.
<em>else:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes after the code
    # in the try block if the code in the try block
    # did not cause any function to raise an exception.
<em>finally:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes after all the other
    # code in try, except, and else blocks regardless of
    # whether an exception was raised or not.</pre></div>

    <p>As shown in example&nbsp;1 above, when we want to write code that
    will handle exceptions, we first write a <code>try</code> block, and
    we put into that <code>try</code> block the normal code that might
    cause an exception. Then we write <code>except</code> blocks to
    handle the exceptions. Each <code>except</code> block may handle one
    type of exception like the code at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;9</span>:</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">except ZeroDivisionError as zero_div_err:</pre></div>

    <p>Or each <code>except</code> block may handle several types of
    exceptions, like the code at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;15</span>:</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">except (TypeError, KeyError, IndexError) as error:</pre></div>

    <p>Or one <code>except</code> block may handle all possible types of
    exceptions, like the code at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;19</span>:</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">except Exception as excep:</pre></div>

    <p>Or a bare <code>except</code> block may handle anything that can
    be raised, including <code>SystemExit</code>,
    <code>KeyboardInterrupt</code> and <code>GeneratorExit</code>, like
    the code at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;23</span>:</p>
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">except:</pre></div>

    <p>The Python programming language requires us to order
    <code>except</code> blocks from most specific at the top to least
    specific (most general) at the bottom. However, in most programs, it
    is a bad idea to write <code>except</code> blocks that are very
    general, including an <code>except</code> block that handles all
    possible exception types
    (<span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;19</span>)
    and a bare <code>except</code> block
    (<span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;23</span>).</p>

    <p>It is usually a bad idea to write an <code>except</code> block that
    handles all types of exceptions or a bare except block because such
    a block will handle <code>SyntaxError</code>. Normally, a program
    should not handle <code>SyntaxError</code>. Instead, a program
    should crash for a syntax error and print the line number where the
    syntax error occurred so that a programmer can find and fix the
    syntax error. As explained in the
    <a href="../lesson06/prepare.html#err_types">prepare content</a>
    for lesson 6, syntax errors are caused by a programmer mistyping
    code and not by bad user input or missing files. A programmer
    should find and fix all syntax errors in a program long before the
    program is given to users, so there is no reason to handle syntax
    errors in an <code>except</code> block.</p>

    <p>As shown at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;27</span> in
    example&nbsp;1 above, following the <code>except</code> blocks, a
    programmer may write an optional <code>else</code> block which the
    computer will execute if the <code>try</code> block does not raise
    any exceptions. It is uncommon to need to write code in the
    <code>else</code> block of <code>try</code> and <code>except</code>,
    and professional programmers almost never do it.</p>

    <p>As shown at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;31</span> in
    example&nbsp;1 above, at the end of the exception handling code, a
    programmer may write an optional <code>finally</code> block. The
    <code>finally</code> block contains code that the computer executes
    after all the other code in the <code>try</code>,
    <code>except</code>, and <code>else</code> blocks regardless of
    whether an exception was raised or not. The code in the
    <code>finally</code> block usually contains "clean up" code that
    frees resources that the code in the <code>try</code> block used.
    For example, if the code in the <code>try</code> block opens a file,
    the code in the <code>finally</code> block could close that file. In
    CSE&nbsp;111, you won't need to write a <code>finally</code>
    block.</p>

    <h2 id="except_types">Common Exception Types</h2>
    <p>There are many different types of
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html">built-in
    exceptions</a> that may occur while a Python program is running.
    This section shows how seven types of exceptions may occur.</p>

    <h3 id="type_err">TypeError</h3>
    <p>The computer raises a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError"><code>TypeError</code></a>
    when the code that calls a function passes an argument with the
    wrong data type. The code in example&nbsp;2 attempts to pass a
    string to the <code>round</code> function. This causes the computer
    to raise a <code>TypeError</code> because the <code>round</code>
    function cannot round a string to an integer. It can round only a
    number to an integer. The output below example&nbsp;2 shows that the
    computer raised a <code>TypeError</code>.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex2"><pre class="python"># Example 2

def main():
    try:
        text = input("Please enter a number: ")
        integer = round(text)
        print(integer)

    except TypeError as type_err:
        print(type_err)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="ex2">&gt; python type_error.py
Please enter a number: <span class="input">25.7</span>
type str doesn't define __round__ method</pre>

    <h3 id="value_err">ValueError</h3>
    <p>The computer raises a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError"><code>ValueError</code></a>
    when the code that calls a function passes an argument with the
    correct data type but with an invalid value. A common event that
    causes the computer to raise a <code>ValueError</code> is when the
    <code>int</code> function or <code>float</code> function tries to
    convert a string to a number but the string contains characters that
    are not digits. The code in example&nbsp;3 and its output show a
    <code>ValueError</code>.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex3"><pre class="python"># Example 3

def main():
    try:
        number = float(input("Please enter a number: "))
        print(number)

    except ValueError as val_err:
        print(val_err)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="ex3">&gt; python value_error.py
Please enter a number: <span class="input">45.7u</span>
could not convert string to float: '45.7u'</pre>

    <h3 id="zero_div_err">ZeroDivisionError</h3>
    <p>The computer raises a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ZeroDivisionError"><code>ZeroDivisionError</code></a>
    when a program attempts to divide a number by zero (0) as shown in
    example&nbsp;4 and its output.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex4"><pre class="python"># Example 4

def main():
    try:
        players = int(input("Enter the number of players: "))
        teams = int(input("Enter the number of teams: "))

        players_per_team = players / teams

        print(f"Each team should have {players_per_team} players")

    except ZeroDivisionError as zero_div_err:
        print(zero_div_err)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="ex4">&gt; python zero_div_error.py
Enter the number of players: <span class="input">20</span>
Enter the number of teams: <span class="input">0</span>
division by zero</pre>

    <h3 id="index_err">IndexError</h3>
    <p>Recall from <a href="../lesson07/prepare.html">lesson&nbsp;7</a>
    that each element in a list is stored at a unique index and that an
    index is always an integer. If we write code that tries to use an
    index that doesn't exist in a list, when the computer executes that
    code, the computer will raise an
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndexError"><code>IndexError</code></a>.
    The program in example&nbsp;5 creates a list that contains three
    surnames. Then the program attempts to change the surname at
    index&nbsp;3. Of course, the list contains only three elements, and
    the index of the last element is 2, so the statement fails and
    causes the computer to raise an <code>IndexError</code>.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex5"><pre class="python"># Example 5

def main():
    try:
        # Create a list that contains three family names.
        surnames = ["Smith", "Lopez", "Marsh"]

        # Attempt to change the surname at index 3. Because
        # there are only three names in the surnames list and
        # therefore the last index is 2, this statement will
        # fail and cause the computer to raise an IndexError.
        surnames[3] = "Olsen"

    except IndexError as index_err:
        print(index_err)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="ex5">&gt; python index_error_write.py
list assignment index out of range</pre>

    <p>The program in example&nbsp;6 is similar to example&nbsp;5, and
    both programs cause the computer to raise an
    <code>IndexError</code>. The program in example&nbsp;6 creates a
    list that contains three surnames. Then the program attempts to
    print the surname at index&nbsp;3. Of course, this statement fails
    because the list contains only three elements, and the index of the
    last element is 2.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex6"><pre class="python"># Example 6

def main():
    try:
        # Create a list that contains three family names.
        surnames = ["Smith", "Lopez", "Marsh"]

        # Attempt to print the surname at index 3. Because
        # there are only three names in the surnames list and
        # therefore the last index is 2, this statement will
        # fail and cause the computer to raise an IndexError.
        print(surnames[3])

    except IndexError as index_err:
        print(index_err)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="ex6">&gt; python index_error_read.py
list index out of range</pre>

    <h3 id="key_err">KeyError</h3>
    <p>As shown in example&nbsp;7, if we write code that attempts to
    find a key in a dictionary and that key doesn't exist in the
    dictionary, then the computer will raise a
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyError"><code>KeyError</code></a>.

<div class="pre" id="ex7"><pre class="python"># Example 7

def main():
    try:
        # Create a dictionary with student IDs as
        # the keys and student names as the values.
        students = {
            "42-039-4736": "Clint Huish",
            "61-315-0160": "Amelia Davis",
            "10-450-1203": "Ana Soares",
            "75-421-2310": "Abdul Ali",
            "07-103-5621": "Amelia Davis"
        }

        # Attempt to find the key "50-420-1021",
        # which is not in the dictionary. This will
        # cause the computer to raise a KeyError.
        name = students["50-420-1021"]

        print(name)

    except KeyError as key_err:
        print(type(key_err).__name__, key_err)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="ex7">&gt; python key_error.py
KeyError '50-420-1021'</pre>

    <p>Of course, it is very unlikely that a programmer would write a
    program that tries to find a hard-coded key that is not in a
    dictionary. However, it is common for a user to enter a key that is
    not in a dictionary. This is why the programs in
    <a href="../lesson08/prepare.html#ex1">examples&nbsp;1</a>
    <a href="../lesson08/prepare.html#ex4">and&nbsp;4</a> in the prepare
    content for lesson&nbsp;8 include an <code>if</code> statement
    above the line of code that searches the dictionary, like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
    # Get a student ID from the user.
    id = input("Enter a student ID: ")

    # Check if the student ID is in the dictionary.
    <em>if id in students:</em>

        # Find the student ID in the dictionary and
        # retrieve the corresponding student name.
        name = students[id]

        # Print the student's name.
        print(name)

    else:
        print("No such student")</pre></div>

    <h3 id="file_not_found_err">FileNotFoundError</h3>
    <p>If we write a call to the <code>open</code> function that
    attempts to open a file for reading and that file doesn't exist, the
    computer will raise a
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#FileNotFoundError"><code>FileNotFoundError</code></a>.
    Example&nbsp;8 contains code where such an error might occur.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex8"><pre class="python"># Example 8

def main():
    try:
        with open("products.vcs", "rt") as products_file:
            for line in products_file:
                print(line)

    except FileNotFoundError as not_found_err:
        print(not_found_err)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console" data-for="ex8">&gt; python file_not_found.py
[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'products.vcs'</pre>

    <h3 id="perm_err">PermissionError</h3>
    <p>Nearly all computer operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows,
    Mac OS X, and Linux, allow multiple people to use a single computer.
    Because people need to store private data in files on a computer,
    the operating systems implement file access permission rules. These
    rules help to prevent unauthorized access to files.</p>

    <p>If we write a call to the <code>open</code> function that
    attempts to open a file and the person executing our program doesn't
    have permission to access the file, the computer will raise a
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#PermissionError"><code>PermissionError</code></a>.
    Example&nbsp;9 contains code where such an error might occur.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex9"><pre class="python"># Example 9

def main():
    try:
        with open("contacts.csv", "rt") as contacts_file:

    <h2 id="validate_input">Validating User Input</h2>
    <p>To <dfn>validate user input</dfn> means to check user input to
    ensure it is in the correct format before using that input. The
    program in example&nbsp;12 validates user input by handling
    exceptions. Notice in the <code>get_float</code> function at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex12">line&nbsp;14</span> there is a
    <code>try</code> block. The <code>try</code> block is part of a loop
    that validates user input in the <code>get_float</code> function.
    Notice at <span class="cross" data-ref="ex12">line&nbsp;44</span>
    that the <code>except</code> block handles <code>ValueError</code>
    which is the type of exception that the <code>float</code> function
    raises when it tries to convert text to a number but the text
    contains characters that are not numeric.</p>

    <p>If the concepts above seem vague, these tutorials may clear some
    confusion for you:</p>

    <ul class="tutorials">
        <li><div>Python Exceptions: <a href="https://realpython.com/python-exceptions/">An Introduction</a></div></li>
        <li><div>Official Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html">Errors and Exceptions tutorial</a></div></li>

    </ul>

    <p>The official Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#bltin-exceptions">built-in
    exceptions reference</a> contains a list of all the built-in
    exceptions. It also includes the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy">class
    hierarchy</a> for the built-in exceptions that is helpful for
    ordering <code>except</code> blocks from most specific to most
    general.</p>

    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
    <p>Errors and exceptional situations sometimes occur while a program
    is running. When an exceptional situation occurs, a computer will
    raise an exception. With the <code>try</code> and <code>except</code>
    keywords, you can write Python code that will handle exceptions.
    Write normal program code inside a <code>try</code> block and write
    an <code>except</code> block for each type of exception that you
    want your program to handle.</p>

    <p>There are many types of exceptions in Python, but there are only
    seven types that your code will need to handle in
    CSE&nbsp;111: <code>TypeError</code>, <code>ValueError</code>,
    <code>ZeroDivisionError</code>, <code>IndexError</code>,
    <code>KeyError</code>, <code>FileNotFoundError</code>, and
    <code>PermissionError</code>. When writing code that writes to or
    reads from a file, a programmer usally writes <code>try</code> and
    <code>except</code> blocks to handle <code>FileNotFoundError</code>
    and <code>PermissionError</code>. Also, when writing code that gets
    input from a user, a programmer usually writes <code>try</code> and
    <code>except</code> blocks to help validate the user's input.</p>
