    <h1>10 Prepare: Handling Exceptions</h1>
    <p>Errors and exceptional situations sometimes occur while a program
    is running. Such errors include a program attempting to read from a
    file that doesn't exist, a connection error when connecting to a
    server on a network, data that cannot be found on a server, and
    calculations that produce undefined results. A well written program
    doesn't crash when an error occurs but instead handles errors in a
    graceful manner that may include adjusting to an error, printing an
    error message for the user to see, and saving an error message to a
    log file. During this lesson, you will learn to write code that
    handles errors that may occur while your Python program is
    running.</p>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn during this lesson.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>An <dfn>exception</dfn> is a relatively rare event that
        sometimes occurs while a Python program is running. For example,
        an exception occurs when a Python program tries to open a file
        for reading, and that file doesn't exist. There are many different
        <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html">built-in
        exceptions</a> that may occur while a Python program is
        running.</div></li>

        <li><div>When an exceptional event occurs, a Python function
        <dfn>raises</dfn> an exception which may be handled by code at
        another location in the executing Python program. The Python
        keyword to raise an exception is <code>raise</code>. Normally,
        you will not need to write code to raise an exception because
        the built-in functions, such as <code>open</code>,
        <code>int</code>, and <code>float</code>, will raise an
        exception when necessary.</div></li>

        <li><div>The Python keywords to handle exceptions are
        <code>try</code>, <code>except</code>, <code>else</code>, and
        <code>finally</code>. The following example code contains the
        outline of a complete try-except-else-finally block. Read the
        code and its comments carefully to understand the correct syntax
        and organization of a try-except-else-finally block.

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python" id="ex1"># Example 1

<em>try</em>:
    # Write normal code here. This block must include
    # code that falls into two groups:
    # 1. Code that may cause an exception to be raised
    # 2. Code that depends on the results from the code
    #    in the first group
<em>except ZeroDivisionError as zero_div_err:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in the
    # try block caused a ZeroDivisionError to be raised.
<em>except ValueError as val_err:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in
    # the try block caused a ValueError to be raised.
<em>except (TypeError, KeyError, IndexError) as error:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in the try
    # block raised a TypeError, KeyError, or IndexError.
<em>except Exception as excep:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in the
    # try block caused any exception to be raised that was
    # not handled by one of the previous except blocks.
<em>except:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes if the code in the
    # try block caused anything to be raised that was
    # not handled by one of the previous except blocks.
<em>else:</em>
    # Code that the computer executes after the code
    # in the try block if the code in the try block
    # did not raise any exceptions.
<em>finally:</em>
    # Code that is executed after all the other code in
    # try, except, and else blocks regardless of whether
    # an exception was raised or not.</pre></div></div></li>

        <li><div>As shown in example&nbsp;1 above, when we want to write
        code that will handle exceptions, we first write a
        <code>try</code> block, and we put into that <code>try</code>
        block the normal code that might cause an exception.
        Then we write <code>except</code> blocks to handle the
        exceptions. Each <code>except</code> block may handle one type
        of exception such as:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">except ValueError as val_err:</pre></div>
        Or each <code>except</code> block may handle several types of
        exceptions, such as:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">except (TypeError, KeyError, IndexError) as error:</pre></div>
Or one <code>except</code> block may handle all possible types of
exceptions such as:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">except Exception as excep:</pre></div>
Or a bare <code>except</code> block may handle anything that can
be raised, including <code>SystemExit</code>,
<code>KeyboardInterrupt</code> and <code>GeneratorExit</code>
such as:
<div class="pre"><pre class="python">except:</pre></div>

        <p>The Python programming language requires us to order
        <code>except</code> blocks from most specific at the top to
        least specific (most general) at the bottom. However, in most
        programs, it is a bad idea to write <code>except</code> blocks
        that are very general, including an <code>except</code> block
        that handles all possible exception types and a bare
        <code>except</code> block.</p>

        <p>It is a bad idea to write an <code>except</code> block that
        handles all types of exceptions because such a block will handle
        <code>SyntaxError</code>. Normally, a program should not handle
        <code>SyntaxError</code>. Instead, a program should crash for a
        syntax error and print the line number where the syntax error
        occurred so that a programmer can find and fix the syntax error.
        Syntax errors are caused by a programmer mistyping code and not
        by bad user input or missing files. We want a programmer to find
        and fix all the syntax errors in a program long before the
        program is given to users.</div></li>

        <li><div>As shown at
        <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;26</span> in
        example&nbsp;1 above, following the <code>except</code> blocks,
        we may write an optional <code>else</code> block which the
        computer will execute if the <code>try</code> block does not
        raise any exceptions. It is uncommon to need to write code in
        the <code>else</code> block of <code>try</code> and
        <code>except</code>, and professional programmers almost never
        do it.</div></li>

        <li><div>As shown at
        <span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;30</span> in
        example&nbsp;1 above, at the end of the exception handling code,
        we may write an optional <code>finally</code> block. The
        <code>finally</code> block contains code that the computer
        executes after all the other code in the <code>try</code>,
        <code>except</code>, and <code>else</code> blocks regardless of
        whether an exception was raised or not. The code in the
        <code>finally</code> block usually contains "clean up" code that
        frees resources that the code in the <code>try</code> block
        used. For example, if the code in the <code>try</code> block
        opens a file, the code in the <code>finally</code> block could
        close that file. In CSE&nbsp;111, you probably won't need to
        write a <code>finally</code> block.</div></li>

    <h2>Common Exception Types</h2>
    <p>There are many different types of
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html">built-in
    exceptions</a> that may occur while a Python program is running.
    This section shows how six types of exceptions may occur.</p>

    <h3>TypeError</h3>
    <p>The computer raises a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError"><code>TypeError</code></a>
    when the code that calls a function passes an argument with the
    wrong type. The code in example&nbsp;2 attempts to pass a string of
    text to the <code>round</code> function which causes the computer to
    raise <code>TypeError</code> as shown in the output below the code
    example.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex2"># Example 2

def main():
    try:
        integer = round("5.2")
        print(integer)

    except TypeError as type_err:
        print(type_err)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console">&gt; python type_error.py
type str doesn't define __round__ method</pre>

    <h3>ValueError</h3>
    <p>The computer raises a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError"><code>ValueError</code></a>
    when the code that calls a function passes an argument with the
    correct type but with an invalid value. A common event that causes
    the computer to raise a <code>ValueError</code> is when the
    <code>int</code> function or <code>float</code> function tries to
    convert a string to a number but the string contains characters that
    are not digits. The code in example&nbsp;3 and its output show a
    <code>ValueError</code>.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex3"># Example 3

def main():
    try:
        number = float(input("Please enter a number: "))
        print(number)

    except ValueError as val_err:
        print(val_err)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console">&gt; python value_error.py
Please enter a number: <span class="input">45.7u</span>
could not convert string to float: '45.7u'</pre>

    <h3>ZeroDivisionError</h3>
    <p>The computer raises a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ZeroDivisionError"><code>ZeroDivisionError</code></a>
    when a program attempts to divide a number by zero (0) as shown in
    example&nbsp;4 and its output.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex4"># Example 4

def main():
    try:
        players = int(input("Enter the number of players: "))
        teams = int(input("Enter the number of teams: "))

        players_per_team = players / teams

        print(f"Each team should have {players_per_team} players.")

    except ZeroDivisionError as zero_div_err:
        print(zero_div_err)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console">&gt; python zero_div_error.py
Enter the number of players: <span class="input">20</span>
Enter the number of teams: <span class="input">0</span>
division by zero</pre>

    <h3>IndexError</h3>
    <p>If we write code that tries to use an index that doesn't exist in
    a list, when the computer executes that code, the computer will
    raise an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#IndexError"><code>IndexError</code></a>.
    The program in example&nbsp;5 creates a list that contains three
    surnames. Then the program attempts to change the surname at
    index&nbsp;3. Of course, this statement fails and causes the
    computer to raise an <code>IndexError</code> because the list
    contains only three elements, and the last index is 2.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex5"># Example 5

def main():
    try:
        # Create a list that contains three family names.
        surnames = ["Smith", "Lopez", "Marsh"]

        # Attempt to change the surname at index 3. Because there
        # are only three names in the surnames list and therefore
        # the last index is 2, this statement will fail and cause
        # the computer to raise an IndexError.
        surnames[3] = "Olsen"

    except IndexError as index_err:
        print(index_err)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console">&gt; python index_error.py
list assignment index out of range</pre>

    <p>The program in example&nbsp;6 is similar to example&nbsp;5, and
    both programs cause the computer to raise an
    <code>IndexError</code>. The program in example&nbsp;6 creates a
    list that contains three surnames. Then the program attempts to
    print the surname at index&nbsp;3. Of course, this statement fails
    because the list contains only three elements, and the last index is
    2.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex6"># Example 6

def main():
    try:
        # Create a list that contains three family names.
        surnames = ["Smith", "Lopez", "Marsh"]

        # Attempt to print the surname at index 3. Because there
        # are only three names in the surnames list and therefore
        # the last index is 2, this statement will fail and cause
        # the computer to raise an IndexError.
        print(surnames[3])

    except IndexError as index_err:
        print(index_err)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console">&gt; python index_error.py
list index out of range</pre>

    <h3>KeyError</h3>
    <p>If we write code that attempts to find a key in a dictionary and
    that key doesn't exist in the dictionary as shown in example&nbsp;7,
    then the computer will raise a <code>KeyError</code>.

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex7"># Example 7

def main():
    try:
        # Create a dictionary with student IDs as
        # the keys and student names as the values.
        students = {
            "42-039-4736": "Clint Huish",
            "61-315-0160": "Michelle Davis",
            "10-450-1203": "Jorge Soares",
            "75-421-2310": "Abdul Ali",
            "07-103-5621": "Michelle Davis"
        }

        # Attempt to find the key "50-420-1021",
        # which is not in the dictionary. This will
        # cause the computer to raise a KeyError.
        name = students["50-420-1021"]

        print(name)

    except KeyError as key_err:
        print(type(key_err).__name__, key_err)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console">&gt; python key_error.py
KeyError '50-420-1021'</pre>

    <p>Of course, it is very unlikely that a programmer would write a
    program that tries to find a hard-coded key that is not in a
    dictionary. However, it is common for a user to enter a key that is
    not in a dictionary. This is why the example code in lesson&nbsp;8
    includes an <code>if</code> statement above the line of code that
    searches the dictionary, like this:</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">
    # Get a student ID from the user.
    id = input("Enter a student ID: ")

    # Check if the student ID is in the dictionary.
    <em>if id in students:</em>

        # Find the student ID in the dictionary and
        # retrieve the corresponding student name.
        name = students[id]

        # Print the student's name.
        print(name)

    else:
        print("No such student")</pre></div>

    <h3>FileNotFoundError</h3>
    <p>If we write a call to the <code>open</code> function that
    attempts to open a file for reading and that file doesn't exist, the
    computer will raise a <code>FileNotFoundError</code>. Example&nbsp;8
    contains code where such an error might occur.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex8"># Example 8

def main():
    try:
        with open("products.vcs", "rt") as products_file:
            for line in products_file:
                print(line)

    except FileNotFoundError as file_not_found_err:
        print(file_not_found_err)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()</pre></div>

<pre class="console">&gt; python file_not_found.py
[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'products.vcs'</pre>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Example&nbsp;9 contains a complete program with
    <code>except</code> blocks to handle two types of exceptions:&nbsp;
    <code>ValueError</code> and <code>ZeroDivisionError</code>.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex9"># Example 9

"""

this program, which computes the number of sandwiches per

    <h2>Example - Reading from a File</h2>
    <p>The program in example&nbsp;10 below handles exceptions that
    might occur when the program opens and reads from a file. This
    program contains only one <code>try</code> block, which begins at
    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex10">line&nbsp;12</span> and includes
    all the regular code in the <code>main</code> function. This one
    <code>try</code> block has three <code>except</code> blocks at

    <span class="cross" data-ref="ex11">line&nbsp;28</span> there is a
    <code>try</code> block. The <code>try</code> block is part of a loop
    that validates user input in the <code>get_float</code> function.
    Notice at <span class="cross" data-ref="ex11">line&nbsp;43</span>
    that the <code>except</code> block handles
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError"><code>ValueError</code></a>
    which is the type of exception that the
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float"><code>float</code></a>
    function raises when it tries to convert text to a number but the
    text contains characters that are not numeric.</p>
