    <h1>10 Prepare: Data Visualization</h1>
    <p><dfn>Data visualization</dfn> is the graphical representation of
    data in charts and graphs to help people visualize and understand
    data more easily than they would by looking at tables of numbers.
    Data visualization is closely related to and often comes after data
    analysis. In other words, a data scientist will often perform data
    analysis to process large data sets and then employ data
    visualization techniques to make charts and graphs from the
    data.</p>

    <p>The <code>pandas</code> module includes functions to draw
    different types of charts. In <code>pandas</code>, charts are called
    plots. Interestingly, the plots are not actually drawn by
    <code>pandas</code> but instead by another Python module named
    <code>matplotlib.pyplot</code>.</p>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn during this lesson.</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>We can use the functions that are part of the
        <code>pandas</code> <code>DataFrame.plot</code> object to draw
        different types of plots, including line, vertical bar,
        horizontal bar, histogram, box, pie, and scatter.</div></li>

        <li><div>Drawing a plot can be as simple as these three steps:
        <ol>
            <li><div>read the data</div></li>
            <li><div>define the plot</div></li>
            <li><div>draw (show) the plot</div></li>
        </ol>
        For example:
<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="python">
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot

# Read a DataFrame from a CSV file.
df = pd.read_csv("filename.csv")

# Define a vertical bar plot from the DataFrame.
df.plot(kind="bar", x="column_name_1", y="column_name_2")

# Draw and show all defined plots.
pyplot.show()</pre></div>

        In the above example, lines 2 and 11 are easy to forget but
        without them, the plots that your code defines will not be shown
        on the computer's monitor.</div></li>

        <li><div>Although drawing a plot can be very simple, a data
        scientist may have to write significant amounts of code to
        analyze and process the data before defining a plot. This
        analysis code is the type of code that you learned to write in
        the previous lesson of this course.</div></li>

        <li><div>There are many options that you can use in your code to
        modify the look and layout of a plot. Some of these options are
        not available through the <code>pandas</code> functions but
        instead are available through the <code>matplotlib.pyplot</code>
        functions.</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>Here are two plots that were drawn by this
    <a download href="sample_plots.py">Python program</a> using
    <code>pandas</code> and <code>matplotlib.pyplot</code>. Both plots
    show the exact same data, first as a pie plot and then as a vertical
    bar plot. Although pie plots are very popular, most data scientists
    don't use them because they convey less information than a bar
    plot.</p>
