    <h1>10 Prepare: Comma Separated Values</h1>
    <p>In this lesson, you will learn how to store and retrieve data
    from Python lists and dictionaries.</p>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Here are the Python programming concepts and topics that you
    should learn during this lesson:</p>

    <h3 id="csvFiles">Comma Separated Values</h3>
    <p>Many computer systems import and export data in CSV files. CSV is
    an acronym for comma separated values. A CSV file is a text file
    that contains tabular data where each row is on a separate line and
    each cell (column) is separated by a comma. The following example is
    the contents of a CSV file that stores information about some dental
    offices in Rexburg, Idaho. Notice that the first row of the file
    contains column headings, the next four rows contain information
    about four dental offices, and each row contains three columns
    separated by commas.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="csv">
Company Name,Address,Phone Number
Eagle Rock Dental Care,556 Trejo Suite C,208-359-2224
Apple Tree Dental,33 Winn Drive Suite 2,208-359-1500
Rockhouse Dentistry,106 E 1st N,208-356-5600
Cornerstone Family Dental,44 S Center Street,208-356-4240
</pre></div>

    <p>Python has a module named
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html"><code>csv</code></a>
    that includes functionality to read and write data from CSV files.
    The following example code shows how to open a CSV file and use the
    <code>csv</code> module to read and print each row.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex5">
import csv

# Open a file named dentists.csv and store a reference
# to the opened file in a variable named infile.
with open("dentists.csv", "rt") as infile:

    # Use the csv module to create a reader
    # object that will read from the opened file.
    reader = csv.reader(infile)

    # The first line of the CSV file contains column headings
    # and not information about a dental office, so this
    # statement skips the first line of the CSV file.
    next(reader)

    # Read each row one at a time as a list.
    for row in reader:

        # For the current row, retrieve the
        # values in columns 0, 1, and 2.
        company = row[0]
        address = row[1]
        phone = row[2]

        # Print the values for the user to see.
        print(company, address, phone)</pre></div>

    <p>You could use this example code in a program that you write, but
    of course, you could modify the <code>for</code> loop in the code to
    do much more than simply print the contents of each row. For
    example, the next code sample shows how to read the contents of a
    CSV file into a dictionary.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python" id="ex6">
import csv

# Create an empty dictionary that will
# store the data from the CSV file.
<em>dentists = {}</em>

# Open a file named dentists.csv and store a reference
# to the opened file in a variable named infile.
with open("dentists.csv", "rt") as infile:

    # Use the csv module to create a reader
    # object that will read from the opened file.
    reader = csv.reader(infile)

    # The first line of the CSV file contains column headings
    # and not information about a dental office, so this
    # statement skips the first line of the CSV file.
    next(reader)

    # Read each row one at a time as a list.
    for row in reader:

        # For the current row, retrieve the
        # values in columns 0, 1, and 2.
        company = row[0]
        address = row[1]
        phone = row[2]

        # Store the data from the current row into the dentists
        # dictionary. Use the phone number as the key. Create a
        # list with the company name and address as the value.
        <em>dentists[phone] = [company, address]</em>

# Print the entire dentists dictionary.
print(dentists)</pre></div>
