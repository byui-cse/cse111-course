		<h1>01 Checkpoint: User Input, Arithmetic, and Output</h1>

		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Demonstrate your understanding of user input, variables,
		arithmetic, and output by completing the following individual
		checkpoint assignment.</p>

		<h2>Assignment</h2>
		<p>When you physically exercise to strengthen your heart, you
		should maintain your heart rate within a range. To find that
		range, subtract your age from 220. This difference is your
		maximum heart rate per minute. Your heart simply will not beat
		faster than this maximum (220 &minus; age). When exercising to
		strengthen your heart, you should keep your heart rate between
		65% and 85% of your heart&rsquo;s maximum. Write a Python
		program that asks for a person&rsquo;s age and computes and
		outputs the slowest and fastest rates necessary to strengthen
		his heart.</p>

		<h2>Instructor&rsquo;s Code</h2>
		<p>When you program is finished, please view the
		<a target="_blank" href="check01_instructor.py"
		download>instructor&rsquo;s version</a> of this
		program to compare your program to that one.</p>

		<p>You should work to complete this checkpoint program first,
		without looking at the instructor&rsquo;s code. However, if you
		have worked on it for at least an hour and are still having
		problems, feel free to use the <a target="_blank" download
		href="check01_instructor.py">instructor&rsquo;s code</a>
		to help you finish your program.</p>

		<h2>Submission</h2>
		<p>When complete, please report your progress in the associated
		I-Learn quiz.</p>
