    <h1>01 Checkpoint: Exercise Heart Rates</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Demonstrate your understanding of user input, variables,
    arithmetic, and output by completing the following individual
    checkpoint assignment.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>When you physically exercise to strengthen your heart, you
    should maintain your heart rate within a range for at least 20
    minutes. To find that range, subtract your age from 220. This
    difference is your maximum heart rate per minute. Your heart
    simply will not beat faster than this maximum (220 &minus; age).
    When exercising to strengthen your heart, you should keep your
    heart rate between 65% and 85% of your heart&rsquo;s
    maximum.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>Write a Python program that asks for a person&rsquo;s age and
    computes and outputs the slowest and fastest rates necessary to
    strengthen his heart.</p>

    <h2>Sample Run</h2>
<pre class="console">Please enter your age: <span class="input">23</span>
When you exercise to strengthen your heart, you should
keep your heart rate between 128 and 167 beats per minute.</pre>

    <h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each
    step in this testing procedure:</p>
    <ol class="test long">
        <li><div>Run your program using the input shown in the
        sample run section above. Ensure that your program's output
        matches the sample run output.</div></li>
        <li><div>Run your program using your age or the age of one
        of your parents. Use a calculator to ensure that the output
        is correct.</div></li>
        <li><div>Run your program again and enter the age of 24.7.
        Did your program output valid results? What should your
        program do when a user enters his age with a decimal
        place?</div></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>When your program is finished, view the <a download
    href="check_solution.py">sample solution</a> for this assignment to
    compare your solution to that one. Before looking at the sample
    solution, you should work to complete this checkpoint program first.
    However, if you have worked on it for at least an hour and are still
    having problems, feel free to use the sample solution to help you
    finish your program.</p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>When complete, report your progress in the associated I-Learn
    quiz.</p>
