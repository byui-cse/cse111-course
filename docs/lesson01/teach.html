    <h1>01 Class Activity: Review Python</h1>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>With your class, write a simple Python program.</p>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>The time in seconds that a pendulum takes to swing back and forth
    once is given by this formula:</p>

    <div class="block expr"><var>t</var> = 2&pi; <span class="rad"></span><div><hr>&thinsp;<div><var>n</var><hr>9.81</div></div></div>

    <ul>
        <li><div>where <var>t</var> is the time in seconds,</div></li>
        <li><div><var>&pi;</var> is PI, the ratio of the circumference
        divided by the diameter of a circle (use <code>math.pi</code>),
        and</div></li>
        <li><div><var>n</var> is the length of the pendulum in meters.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Activity</h2>
    <p>Write a program named <code>pendulum.py</code> that prompts a
    user to enter the length of a pendulum in meters and then computes
    and prints the time in seconds that it takes for that pendulum to
    swing back and forth. To start your program, copy and paste the
    following code into your program and use it as an outline as you
    write code. Note that in a Python program, a triple quoted string at
    the top of the file acts as a comment for the entire program.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="python">"""
The time in seconds that a pendulum takes to swing
back and forth once is given by this formula:
             ____
            / n
    t = 2π / ----
          √  9.81

where t is the time in seconds,
π is PI the ratio of the circumference divided by
    the diameter of a circle (use math.pi), and
n is the length of the pendulum in meters.

Write a program that prompts a user to enter the length of a
pendulum in meters and then computes and prints the time in
seconds that it takes for that pendulum to swing back and forth.

    <h2>Helpful Documentation</h2>
    <p>The Python <a target="_blank"
    href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html"><code>math</code>
    module</a> contains mathematical constants and functions including
    <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.pi"><code>math.pi</code></a>
    and
    <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.sqrt"><code>math.sqrt()</code></a>.</p>

    <h2>Sample Run</h2>
<pre class="console">&gt; python pendulum.py
Length of pendulum (meters): <span class="input">3</span>
Time (seconds): 3.47</pre>

    <h2>Sample Solution</h2>
    <p>Please work diligently with your class to complete this activity.
    After class is over, please compare your approach to the
    <a download href="teach_solution.py">sample solution</a>. Please
    <strong>do not look at the sample solution</strong> until you have
    either finished the program or diligently worked with your class.</p>
