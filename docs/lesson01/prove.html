		<h1>01 Prove: Arithmetic</h1>

		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Prove that you can write a simple Python program that gets
		input from a user, performs arithmetic, and displays output to
		the user.</p>

		<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
		<p>The size of a car tire in the United States is represented
		with three numbers like this: 205/60R 15. The first number is
		the width of the tire in millimeters. The second number is the
		aspect ratio. The third number is the diameter in inches of the
		wheel that the tire fits. The volume of space inside a tire can
		be approximated with this formula:</p>

		<div class="blockExpr"><var>v</var> = <div>&pi; <var>w</var><sup>2</sup> <var>a</var> (<var>w</var><var>a</var> + 2,540 <var>d</var>)<hr>10,000,000</div></div>

		<p>where <var>v</var> is the volume in cubic centimeters,
		<var>w</var> is the width of the tire in millimeters,
		<var>a</var> is the aspect ratio of the tire, and
		<var>d</var> is the diameter of the wheel in inches.</p>

		<h2>Assignment</h2>
		<p>Write a Python program that reads from the keyboard the three
		numbers for a tire and computes and outputs the volume of space
		inside that tire.</p>

		<h2>Sample Run</h2>
<pre class="console">Enter the width of the tire in cm (ex 205): 185
Enter the aspect ratio of the tire (ex 60): 50
Enter the diameter of the tire in inches (ex 15): 14
24090.1</pre>

		<h2>Testing Procedure</h2>
		<p>Verify that your program works correctly by following each
		step in this testing procedure:</p>
		<ol class="testing">
			<li><div>Run your program using the input shown in the
			sample run section above. Ensure that your program's output
			matches the sample run output.</div></li>
			<li><div>Run your program using these values: 205, 60, 15
			and verify that your program outputs 39924.5</div></li>
			<li><div>Run your program again and enter the values: -140,
			20, 14. Did your program output valid results? What should
			your program do when a user enters negative numbers for this
			program?</div></li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Submission</h2>
		<p>When complete, please report your progress in the associated
		I-Learn quiz.</p>
