        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Over the next two lessons you will complete the follow project. To help stay on track, by the end of this lesson, you'll need to complete a certain set of requirements. Then, you'll have the rest of the next lesson to finish the overall project.</p>

        <p>For your project, you will be using loops to iterate through the pixels of an image and make certain changes to them.</p>

        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>Working with digital images is an important task in many domains. From being able to </p>
        <p>Digital images play an important role in our society today. Because of this, many programs have been written to analyze and manipulate them. One way that images can be stored and accessed is as a large set of individual pixels, each containing a red, green, and blue value from 0-255.</p>
        
        <p>For this project, you'll work with an image of your choosing. Using Python, you will open an input image file and loop through each of the pixels, one by one. Depending on the value of these pixels, you'll need to make certain decisions to potentially change a pixel's value, and save it out as a new, modified output image file.</p>

        <p>For this project, we will use an pre-built library (Python programs that others have written that we can use!) to help us open the images. Please be aware that a library like this is very powerful and can help you do much more than we are using it for, but for this lesson, we simply want the ability to iterate through the pixels one at a time.</p>

        <p>For the functionality component of this project, there are a few thresholds that we hope you will reach, corresponding to different scores for the functionality component of the grade. These are detailed below:</p>

        <h2>Milestone Requirements</h2>
        <p>To ensure that you are prepared to complete the overall assignment by the end of the next lesson, for this lesson you need to complete the following:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>Have the necessary image libraries loaded.</p></li>
            <li><p>Obtain a picture of your choosing and put that file in the same directory as your Python program.</p></li>
            <li><p>Have your program open the image file and iterate through the pixels one by one.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add 50 to the green value of each pixel.</p></li>
            <li><p>Save out a new image (with the higher green values).</p></li>
            <li><p>You can then use a standard image program to open the new image and see the results.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>When complete, answer the questions in the associated I-Learn quiz.</p>
