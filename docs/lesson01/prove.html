		<h1>01 Prove: Arithmetic</h1>

		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Prove that you can write a simple Python program that gets
		input from a user, performs arithmetic, and displays output to
		the user.</p>

		<h2>Project Description</h2>
		<p>The size of a car tire in the United States is represented
		with three numbers like this: 205/60R 15. The first number is
		the width of the tire in millimeters. The second number is the
		aspect ratio. The third number is the diameter in inches of the
		wheel that the tire fits. The volume of space inside a tire can
		be approximated with this formula:</p>

		<div class="blockExpr"><var>v</var> = <div>&pi; <var>w</var><sup>2</sup> <var>a</var> (<var>w</var><var>a</var> + 2,540 <var>d</var>)<hr>10,000,000</div></div>

		<p>where <var>v</var> is the volume in cubic centimeters,
		<var>w</var> is the width of the tire in millimeters,
		<var>a</var> is the aspect ratio of the tire, and
		<var>d</var> is the diameter of the wheel in inches.</p>

		<h2>Project Requirements</h2>
		<p>Write a Python program that reads from the keyboard the three
		numbers for a tire and computes and outputs the volume of space
		inside that tire.</p>

		<h2>Submission</h2>
