        <h1>07 Prepare: Checkpoint</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Demonstrate your understanding of loops by completing the following individual checkpoint assignment.</p>

        <h2>Assignment</h2>
        <p>Write a Python Program that does each of the following:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>Given the following list of items (copy and paste this line into your program):</p>
<pre><code class="python">
colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"]
</code></pre>
            <p>use a <code>for</code> loop to iterate through this list one by one and display each item on its own line as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
red
blue
green
yellow
</code></pre>
                
            </li>

            <li><p>Use a <code>for</code> loop to display the numbers 1-10, one number on each line as follows:</p></li>

<pre><code class="bash">
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
</code></pre>

            <li><p>Use a <code>while</code> loop, to simulate a child asking their parent for a piece of candy. Have the program keep looping until the user answers "yes", then have the program output "Thank you." For example:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">
May I have a piece of candy? no
May I have a piece of candy? no
May I have a piece of candy? no
May I have a piece of candy? no
May I have a piece of candy? yes
Thank you.
</code></pre>       

            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Instructor Code</h2>
        <p>When you program is finished, please view the instructor's version of this program to compare your approach to that one.</p>

        <p>You should work to complete this checkpoint program first, without looking at the instructor code. However, if you have worked on it for at least an hour and are still having problems, you may feel free to use the instructor code to help you finish your program.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Instructor code: <a href="./check07_instructor.py">check07_instructor.py</a></p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>When complete, please report your progress in the associated I-Learn quiz.</p>
