    <h1>13 Prove Assignment: Student Chosen Program</h1>

    <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a significant Python program that solves
    a real-world problem and is well organized with functions.</p>

    <h2 id="assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>Finish developing the program that you started in the
    <a href="../lesson11wwb/prove.html">prove assignment for
    lesson&nbsp;11</a>. Your program must include multiple functions
    that you verify are correct with test functions and
    <code>pytest</code>.</p>

    <h2 id="submit">Submission</h2>
    <p>In order to receive credit for this prove assignment, you must
    submit your program and a report that describes your work on your
    program. Do the following:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>At the <strong>beginning</strong> of this lesson
        (lesson&nbsp;13), download and save this
        <a download href="report_2.txt"><code>report_2.txt</code></a>
        file.</div></li>

        <li><div>Open the downloaded <code>report_2.txt</code> file in
        VS Code. Notice that question #1 in the file requires you to
        record in a table the time that you work on your program. In
        order to receive full points for this prove milestone, you must
        work on your program for at least <strong>six hours</strong>
        during this lesson. As you work on your program during this
        lesson, be certain to record the dates and times and a
        description of your work.</div></li>

        <li><div>At the <strong>beginning</strong> of this lesson, in
        I-Learn in the lesson&nbsp;13 prove assignment, read the rubric
        that a grader will use to score your <code>report_2.txt</code>
        file and your program.</div></li>

        <li><div>At the end of this lesson, in I-Learn in the
        lesson&nbsp;13 prove assignment, submit your completed
        <code>report_2.txt</code> file, your Python program, your Python
        test file, and any data files such as .txt and .csv
        files.</div></li>
