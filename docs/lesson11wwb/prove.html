    <h1>11 Prove Milestone: Student Chosen Program</h1>

    <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
    <p>Prove that you can write a significant Python project that solves
    a real-world problem and is well organized with functions.</p>

    <h2 id="assign">Assignment</h2>
    <p>During this lesson and the next two lessons, write a Python
    program that you choose. Your program must include multiple
    functions that each perform a single task. You must write test
    functions for at least two of your program functions and run your
    test functions with <code>pytest</code>.</p>

    <p>Ideally your program will solve a real-world problem or become a
    tool in a subject area that interests you, such as chemistry,
    physics, geography, fashion, family history, linguistics, social
    work, food science, carpentry, machinery, engineering, mathematics,
    computing, etc. Before you begin writing your program, you must
    <strong>propose your program to your instructor</strong> to ensure
    that the program is neither too easy nor too difficult for the time
    remaining in this course. If you finish your program more quickly
    than you of your instructor expected, and there is time remaining in
    this course, then choose and write another program.</p>

    <h2 id="proposal">Proposal</h2>
    <p>To write a proposal for your program, download and save this
    <a download href="../lesson11/proposal.txt">proposal.txt</a> file.
    Open the downloaded file in VS Code. Answer each of the questions
    and save your file.</p>

    <h2 id="possible">Possible Projects</h2>
    <p>If you find it difficult to choose a program to write, you may
    choose to write one of the following programs:</p>

    <ol class="long">
        <li><div>A program that performs calculations that are useful in
        your major or hobby.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program with a complete graphical user interface
        (GUI), including windows, frames, labels, text fields, and
        buttons. Use either the <code>tkinter</code> or <code>kivy</code>
        module. The team assignment in the next lesson will show you how
        to write code for a simple GUI.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that reads a text file and counts how often
        each word occurs in the file.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that reads English text from a file and
        converts strangely spelled words to a simpler spelling that more
        closely matches their pronunciation. Consider just a few of the
        strangely spelled English words: comb, lamb, have, done, two,
        Wednesday, should, night (“ight” is a blight on the English
        language). For more information, see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language_spelling_reform">English-language
        spelling reform</a> article at Wikipedia.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program to reorganize or rename all the files in a
        collection of files, such as collection of Microsoft Word
        documents, Excel spreadsheets, music (mp3) files, pictures (jpg)
        files. If you choose to write this program, we
        <strong>strongly</strong> suggest that you make a copy of the
        files that your program will reorganize or rename and run your
        program on the copy. This is because it is highly likely that
        you will make mistakes when writing this program, and such
        mistakes may cause the files to be deleted. Really.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that graphically simulates the spread of a
        disease like the simulations in this <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/">Washington
        Post article</a>. Your program should include variables that can
        be changed, such as movement rate, probability of transmission,
        length of contagiousness, length of illness, and probability of
        death.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that retrieves data from a a server on the
        internet. The Python
        <a href="https://docs.python-requests.org"><code>requests</code></a>
        module contains functions that retrieve data from a
        server.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that uses the
        <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org"><code>pandas</code></a>
        module to process a data set and produces charts that help
        people visualize information about the data set.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that retrieves data from a relational
        database. The MySQL Python connector is a Python module that
        enables Python programs to read from and write to a MySQL
        relational database. It was written by the same developers who
        wrote the MySQL server. You can download it from the
        <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/">MySQL downloads
        page</a> and install it on your Windows, Mac OS, or Linux
        computer.</div></li>

        <li><div>A program that retrieves data from a Firebase
        database.</div></li>
    </ol>

    </ul>

    <p>If you don’t understand the description of one of these possible
    projects, ask your CSE&nbsp;111 team members or your instructor to
    explain the project to you.</p>

    <h2 id="organize">Organization</h2>
    <p>As you develop your program, be certain to divide the program
    into functions. Each function should perform a single task and be
    appropriately named. Remember that the most reusable and easily
    testable functions don’t get user input and don’t print results but
    instead have parameters and return a result. Functions that get user
    input and print results are important and do useful work but are not
    easily reusable and testable. It’s fine if some of the functions in
    your program have no parameters, return nothing, get user input,
    and print results, but it’s bad if all of your program functions are
    like that.</p>

    <h2 id="testing">Testing Procedure</h2>
    <p>You should follow good coding practices by writing test functions
    for many of your program functions. Run your test functions with
    <code>pytest</code> to verify that your program functions work
    correctly.</p>

    <p>Some students believe that the program functions they write
    cannot be tested with test functions and <code>pytest</code>. Such
    beliefs are simply false. Below are just some of the reasons that
    students have thought make their program functions untestable and
    example code that shows how to write those test functions. Notice
    that you can expand and collapse the example code by clicking the
    triangle icons
    (<img src="../site/icons/collapsed.png"
    alt="Right facing triangle that shows a topic is collapsed and can be expanded by clicking on it."
    title="Right facing triangle that shows a topic is collapsed and can be expanded by clicking on it."> or
