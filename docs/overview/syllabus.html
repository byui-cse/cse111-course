<article>
    <h1>CSE 111 Syllabus</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>CSE&nbsp;111 students become more organized, efficient, and
    powerful computer programmers by learning to research and call
    functions written by others; write, call, and test their own
    functions; and handle errors within functions. CSE&nbsp;111 students
    write programs with functions to solve problems in many disciplines,
    including business, physical science, human performance, and
    humanities.</p>

    <h2>Outcomes</h2>
    <p>Successful graduates of CSE&nbsp;111 will do the following:</p>

    <h2>Textbook</h2>
    <p>There is no textbook for this course. Instead, I-Learn contains
    links to videos and web pages with the preparation material students
    will need.</p>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>This course will use Python 3 and Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
    These applications are free and available for Windows, MacOS, and
    Linux. Students are expected to have a laptop or desktop computer
    that can run these applications.</p>

    <p>Students will use Slack for communication about the course and
    I-Learn to submit assignments and quizzes.</p>

    <h2>Organization</h2>
    <p>This course is organized into a series of lessons. In the
    semester version of the course, students will complete one lesson
    each week. In the block version of the course, students will
    complete two lessons each week.</p>

    <p>Each lesson is organized as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>Prepare: Content and videos that each student should
        read and watch before beginning the other activities in the
        lesson.</div></li>

        <li><div>Prepare: Checkpoint&mdash;A small individual programming
        assignment designed to help each student practice the concepts
        taught in the prepare content and videos.</div></li>

        <li><div>Teach: Team Activity&mdash;A one-hour programming activity
        that students will will complete in groups of 3&ndash;5
        students. Face-to-face students will complete this activity
        during class. Online students will complete this activity during
        a synchronous video conference that they arrange.</div></li>

        <li><div>Prove: Programming Assignment&mdash;A large individual
        programming project. Many of these span two lessons, with a
        milestone deliverable due at the end of the first
        lesson.</div></li>

        <li><div>Ponder: Check your understanding&mdash;Every other lesson
        will have a multiple-choice quiz to help students check their
        understanding of the topic.</div></li>

        <li><div>Ponder: Reflection&mdash;Every other lesson will contain a
        two question quiz to allow students to reflect on the things
        they are learning.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <p>The grading breakdown for the course is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>15%&mdash;Checkpoints</div></li>
        <li><div>20%&mdash;Team Activities</div></li>
        <li><div>50%&mdash;Assignments</div></li>
        <li><div>10%&mdash;Check Your Understanding</div></li>
        <li><div>5%&mdash;Reflections</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Assignments will be generally graded in broad categories
    according to the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>0%&mdash;Nothing submitted</div></li>
        <li><div>50%&mdash;Some attempt made</div></li>
        <li><div>75%&mdash;Developing (but significantly deficient)</div></li>
        <li><div>85%&mdash;Slightly deficient</div></li>
        <li><div>93%&mdash;Meets requirements</div></li>
        <li><div>100%&mdash;Made it your own. This will be explained in
        the individual assignments, but there is an expectation to
        show creativity and extend your assignments beyond the
        minimum standard that is specifically required.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Letter grades will be awarded as follows:</p>
    <table><thead>
        <tr><th colspan="2">Percentage<br>Range</th> <th>Letter<br>Grade</th></tr>
    </thead><tbody>
        <tr><td class="number">93%</td> <td class="number">100.00%</td> <td>A</td></tr>

    <h2>Late Work</h2>
    <p>For late checkpoints, team activities, and quizzes, there is a
    10% penalty for each day that has passed since the due date, up to a
    maximum of 50% penalty for any given assignment. The larger
    programming assignments are not accepted late. Instead, students
    should submit what they have completed by the due date for partial
    credit. Extenuating circumstances should be discussed with the
    instructor prior to the assignment due date.</p>

    <h2>Honor Code</h2>
    <h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
    <p>Students are expected to follow <a href="http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/academic-honesty" target="_blank">the university's policies for academic honesty</a>.</p>

    <p>Students may work with your classmates but all submitted work for
    projects and assignments must be original. Share ideas; do not share
    code! Assistance from a classmate should be on par with the help
    students would expect from a lab assistant.</p>

    <p>If you work closely with another student, helping teach and learn
    from each other, make sure you each still write your own code, but
    in this case, your solutions may end up being very similar. This is
    completely fine, but please make sure to put a comment in your code
    stating that you wrote your own program, but worked closely with
    that person, and that is why it is similar.</p>

    <p>Students are encouraged to use the Internet as a resource, but
    recognize that they should not copy and paste someone else's work as
    your own. Cite all sources and follow copyright laws. <strong>When
    in doubt, give credit and be upfront</strong>.</p>

    <p>Do not look for or share solutions on "note sharing" internet
    sites.</p>

    <p>The penalty for copying or plagiarism of assignments might be one
    or more of the following: a score of zero (0) on an assignment,
    being asked to withdraw from the class, a failing grade in the
    class, or disciplinary action by the University.</p>

    <h3>Dress and Grooming</h3>
    <p>Students are expected to follow the university's <a href="http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/dress-and-grooming" target="_blank">Dress and Grooming Standards</a></p>

    <h2>Grievance Policy</h2>
    <p>Review the <a href="http://www.byui.edu/catalog/#/policy/SJ8pMAmZr?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Student%20Grievance&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Grievance%20Policy&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Student Grievance Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Student Support</h2>
    <p>Support is available in many ways including via other class
    members and discussion in Slack. In addition, help is available
    through the university's
    <a href="http://www.byui.edu/academic-support-centers">academic
    support center</a>.</p>

    <h2>Sexual Harassment</h2>
    <p>BYU-Idaho is committed to promoting and maintaining a safe and
    respectful environment for the campus community. Sexual misconduct
    is against the law, contrary to the teachings of The Church of Jesus
    Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Honor Code and inconsistent with
    the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, which we hope are embodied
    on our campus. The university prohibits sexual misconduct
    perpetrated by or against university students, university employees,
    participants in university programs, or visitors to its campus,
    whether the behavior occurs on or off campus.</p>
