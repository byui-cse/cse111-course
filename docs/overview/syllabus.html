    <h1>CSE 111 Syllabus</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Outcomes</h2>
    <p>Successful graduates for CSE 111 will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>Call and write functions in programs to accomplish
        meaningful tasks in a variety of domains (C1)</div></li>
        <li><div>Follow good practices in function design (C4)</div></li>
        <li><div>Write programs that can detect and recover from
        invalid conditions (C3)</div></li>
        <li><div>Research and use functions and objects written by
        others (C8)</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Content</h2>
    <p>There is no textbook for this course. Instead, you will be
    provided links to videos and web pages containing the preparation
    material you will need.</p>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>This course will use Python 3 and Visual Studio Code (VS
    Code). These applications are free and available for Windows,
    MacOS, and Linux. You are expected to have a laptop or desktop
    computer that can run these applications.</p>

    <p>You will use Slack for communication about the course and
    I-Learn to submit assignments and quizzes.</p>

    <h2>Organization</h2>
    <p>This course is organized into a series of lessons. In the
    semester version of the course, you will complete one lesson
    each week. In the block version of the course, you will complete
    two lessons each week.</p>

    <p>Each lesson is organized as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>Prepare: Links will be provided to videos and
        reading material that should be completed individually prior
        to moving on to the rest of the lesson.</div></li>

        <li><div>Prepare: Checkpoint - A small individual
        programming assignment designed to help you practice the
        mechanics of the reading.</div></li>

        <li><div>Teach: Team Activity - A 1-hour programming
        activity to be completed with 3-5 other students.
        Face-to-face students will complete this activity during
        class. Online students will arrange a synchronous video
        conference.</div></li>

        <li><div>Prove: Programming Assignment - A large individual
        programming project. Many of these span two lessons, with a
        milestone deliverable coming due at the end of the first
        lesson.</div></li>

        <li><div>Ponder: Check your understanding - Every other
        lesson will have a multiple-choice quiz to help you check
        your understanding of the topic.</div></li>

        <li><div>Ponder: Reflection - Every other week will contain
        a 2-3 question short response to allow you to reflect on the
        things you are learning.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <p>The grading breakdown for the course is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>15% - Checkpoints</div></li>
        <li><div>20% - Team Activities</div></li>
        <li><div>50% - Assignments</div></li>
        <li><div>10% - Check Your Understanding</div></li>
        <li><div>5% - Reflections</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Assignments will be generally graded in broad categories
    according to the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div>0% - Nothing submitted</div></li>
        <li><div>50% - Some attempt made</div></li>
        <li><div>75% - Developing (but significantly deficient)</div></li>
        <li><div>85% - Slightly deficient</div></li>
        <li><div>93% - Meets requirements</div></li>
        <li><div>100% - Made it your own. This will be explained in
        the individual assignments, but there is an expectation to
        show creativity and extend your assignments beyond the
        minimum standard that is specifically required.</div></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Letter grades will be awarded as follows:</p>
    <table><thead>
        <tr><th colspan="2">Percentage<br>Range</th> <th>Letter<br>Grade</th></tr>
    </thead><tbody>
        <tr><td class="number">93%</td> <td class="number">100.00%</td> <td>A</td></tr>
        <tr><td class="number">90%</td> <td class="number">92.99%</td> <td>A&minus;</td></tr>

    <h2>Late work</h2>
    <p>For late checkpoints, team activities, and quizzes, there is
    a 10% penalty for each day that has passed since the due date,
    up to a maximum of 50% penalty for any given assignment. The
    larger programming assignments are not accepted late. Instead,
    you should submit what you have completed by the due date for
    partial credit. Extenuating circumstances should be discussed
    with the instructor prior to the assignment due date.</p>

    <h2>Honor Code</h2>
    <h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
    <p>You are expected to follow <a href="http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/academic-honesty" target="_blank">the university's policies for academic honesty</a>.</p>

    <p>You may work with your classmates but all submitted work for
    projects and assignments must be original. Share ideas; do not
    share code! Assistance from a classmate should be on par with
    the help you would expect from a lab assistant.</p>

    <p>If you work closely with another student, helping teach and
    learn from each other, make sure you each still write your own
    code, but in this case, your solutions may end up being very
    similar. This is completely fine, but please make sure to put a
    comment in your code stating that you wrote your own program,
    but worked closely with that person, and that is why it is
    similar.</p>

    <p>You are encouraged to use the Internet as a resource, but
    recognize that you should not copy and paste someone elseâ€™s work
    as your own. Cite all sources and follow copyright laws.
    <strong>When in doubt, give credit and be upfront</strong>.</p>

    <p>Do not look for or share solutions on "note sharing" internet
    sites.</p>

    <p>The penalty for copying or plagiarism of assignments might be
    one or more of the following: -100% on an assignment, being
    asked to withdraw from the class, a failing grade in the class,
    or disciplinary action by the University.</p>

    <h3>Dress and Grooming</h3>
    <p>You are expected to follow the university's <a href="http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/dress-and-grooming" target="_blank">Dress and Grooming Standards</a></p>

    <h2>Grievance Policy</h2>
    <p>Review the <a href="http://www.byui.edu/catalog/#/policy/SJ8pMAmZr?bc=true&amp;bcCurrent=Student%20Grievance&amp;bcGroup=Academic%20Grievance%20Policy&amp;bcItemType=policies">Academic Student Grievance Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Student Support</h2>
    <p>Support is available in many ways including via other class
    members and discussion in Slack. In addition, help is available
    through the university's
    <a href="http://www.byui.edu/academic-support-centers">academic
    support center</a>.</p>

    <h2>Sexual Harassment</h2>
    <p>BYU-Idaho is committed to promoting and maintaining a safe
    and respectful environment for the campus community. Sexual
    misconduct is against the law, contrary to the teachings of The
    Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Honor Code
    and inconsistent with the life and teachings of Jesus Christ,
    which we hope are embodied on our campus. The university
    prohibits sexual misconduct perpetrated by or against university
    students, university employees, participants in university
    programs, or visitors to its campus, whether the behavior occurs
    on or off campus.</p>

    working and learning atmosphere that accommodates qualified
    persons with disabilities. If you have a disability and require
