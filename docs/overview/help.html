    <h1>CSE&nbsp;111 Help</h1>

    <p>Finding help for a programming assignment requires time.
    Therefore, it is important that you start each prove assignment as
    soon as you can after completing the preparation content,
    checkpoint, and team activity. In other words, students who wait to
    start a prove assignment until one hour before it is due, often
    encounter errors that prevent them from completing the assignment on
    time. Please start each prove assignment as soon as you can.</p>

    <p>The following resources are available to you to help you
    understand the concepts and complete the assignments in
    CSE&nbsp;111.</p>

    <section>
    <h3>Teammates</h3>
    <p>As a CSE&nbsp;111 student, you are part of a team of students
    from your class. Your team has a channel in Microsoft Teams (or
    Slack) where you can post questions. Any questions that you post in
    your team’s channel can be seen by your teammates and your teacher.
    Because all your teammates and your teacher can see your question,
    there is a good chance that one of them will be able to answer your
    question.</p>

    <h3>Artificial Intelligence Tutor</h3>
    <p>You could use a generative AI as a tutor to help you write and
    troubleshoot your program. Bro. Lee Barney created a custom Chat GPT
    named Pythonista that is fine-tuned to focus on Python functions,
    loops, if statements, and related programming concepts.
    If your program is generating an error, ask
    <a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-sQydCh2Q6-pythonista">Pythonista</a>
    a question like this:</p>

    <blockquote><p>I'm writing a Python program that <b>(type a short
    description of your program here)</b>. When I run my program, it
    causes the following error. Please suggest some mistakes that might
    cause this error.</p>
    <p><b>(Copy and paste the error message here.)</b></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>You could also ask
    <a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-sQydCh2Q6-pythonista">Pythonista</a>
    a question about one of your functions, like this:</p>

    <blockquote><p>I wrote the following Python function that is
    supposed to <b>(type a short description here)</b>. However, the
    function isn't <b>(type what it's not doing correctly here)</b>.
    Please help me fix this function.</p>
    <p><b>(Copy and paste your Python function here.)</b></p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Human Tutor</h3>
    <p>As a BYU-Idaho campus or online student you can get help from a
    tutor to complete your CSE 111 assignments. Each tutor is a current
    BYU-Idaho student employed by BYU-Idaho. Meeting with a tutor is
    free. It will not cost you any money to meet with a tutor. To get
    help from a tutor, you simply make an appointment and then meet with
    the tutor. Campus students meet with tutors in the tutoring center.
    Online students meet with tutors in Zoom. To make an appointment,
    follow the instructions in the
    <a href="https://courses.byui.edu/AcademicSupport/tutoring-center/online-tutoring/online-courses-tutoring-guide.pdf">course tutoring guide</a>.</p>

    <section>
    <h3>Teacher</h3>
    <p>You can send a question to your teacher through I‑Learn or
    e-mail. Remember that most online teachers teach part-time and have
    a different full-time job. This means that most online teachers
    cannot immediately respond to your e-mail. They must wait until
    their full-time job ends for the day, and then they can read and
    respond to your e-mail. This response delay is another reason to
    start each prove assignment as early as you can. When you start an
    assignment early, there will be time for you to send a message to
    your teacher and time for your teacher to respond before the due
    date and time.</p>
